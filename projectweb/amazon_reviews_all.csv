B0CLB4XLCF,Wajeeh,5.0,Great Handheld Console,29 April 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"The Legion Go is a great gaming handheld console, although not perfect.

Design:
The screen is beautiful and really good for watching movies, and the console's integrated kickstand makes it really easy to just prop the console up and enjoy.
The Legion Go has 2 USB C ports - one on the top and one on the bottom, which is really useful from a practicality perspective, especially when gaming as you're not restricted to one port for charging.
The trackpad is a very useful inclusion, and makes navigating Windows much easier.
The detachable joysticks are a really useful feature - you can prop up the display using the kickstand on a desk and use the detachable joysticks to game. It could be made better if there was some sort of accessory (similar to the Nintendo Switch) with which you could connect the two joysticks, as it does feel a little bit weird having two separate controllers.

Setup:
The Legion Go has Windows 11, which is a bit of a double-edged sword - you do get a lot more freedom as standard compared to the Steam Deck, especially as it is easier to use games from Xbox Game Pass, Epic Games, Ubisoft Connect etc., but it does come at the cost of the Legion Go being much less plug and play as compared to the Steam Deck.
On first use you should update Windows and all the drivers - Windows does auto-update on initial setup, however you should check for updates to ensure your device is up to date. Lenovo also has a handy auto-driver update tool on their website, which updates all drivers and even the BIOS, but still expect initial setup to take a couple of hours.

Legion Software:
This is an area where the Legion Go is a bit of a let-down, as it's software isn't as fleshed out as the Steam Deck or even the ROG Ally. If you are quite good with tech and setting up different settings etc., then you won't have an issue. but if you prefer having a more streamlined experience, then it may be better to look elsewhere.
Also, Lenovo has been slow to update drivers and software, especially compared to Asus with their ROG Ally, which is something you may want to keep in mind. Lenovo has however been quite active on social media in terms of communication, which is admirable.

Gameplay:
Gameplay is what you would expect from the Z1 extreme chip, and pretty much on par with other handhelds such as the ROG Ally which also have this chip. There's also plenty of guides online to optimise gameplay, such as changing the VRAM to 6GB in the BIOS. Obviously don't expect to game with settings cranked to max, but the Legion Go still provides a very respectable gaming performance.

Battery:
Battery life ranges from 1.5-3 hours depending on the game you are playing. If you are travelling, then I would highly recommend you invest in a large power bank capable of providing at least 60W of power.

Conclusion:
The Legion Go is a solid device and I am loving it so far, although it does have a few issues. However, it is my preference when compared to the Steam Deck and ROG Ally, mainly due to the detachable joysticks, kickstand, lovely screen and my preference for having Windows, despite the additional work it requires as compared to SteamOS.

B0CLB4XLCF,Amazon Customer,5.0,First handheld better than steam deck,7 March 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"After a few years having an obsession
with owning most handheld pcs and games consoles, nothing has really beaten the steam deck(and later the oled version) in terms of playability and ease of use thanks to not dealing with windows but this beast, with its amd ryzen z1 extreme and its big juicy 2k screen has made it worth it for me and its for a few reasons, first you can simply enter steam in big picture mode to have a ""console like experience"" but there's also the xbox pc app with all its gamepass games and lenovo have taken these, and others like ubisoft connect and epic store and put them all in one launcher that's accessed by a single button, a feature I never knew I needed and this,along with having all the performance settings at the press of another button are all reasons its worth buying and that's before considering the detachable ""joy-con"" controllers that can be combined with a (sadly seperately sold) adapter to make them into a traditional controller and of course the consoles party trick, the included adapter is a dock that can turn the right controller into a gaming mouse that, unsurprisingly is better for shooting games and makes it great for pc gamers,overall if you want to be able to play any current pc game with decent frame rate and graphics settings and wait the choice of console or mouse gaming, you won't find anything better yet and it will be a good few years before it's not worth gaming on at all.",0
B0CLB4XLCF,SD,1.0,Not an Xbox handheld,24 April 2025,the United Kingdom,False,"Been looking for an Xbox handheld to play all my Gamepass games.

This is not it unfortunately.

Set up
The is fairly easy and straightforward with lots of people who can help online from YouTube to forums.

Battery life 🔋
This was pretty awful. I got around 1h 15mins which I found shocking as it ment I was always plugged into a charger (which isnt very portable)

Build Quality ⭐
This is amazing, the screen the joycons and the case is amazing. It even has a little flap to allow you to change your computer when inside the case which is a great idea.

Gaming 🎮
I bought this to play Gamepass games but unfortunately it would kick you out in the middle of games, lag when moving around and was at times unplayable.

I really wanted to love the Legion Go.
The display is huge and crisp when playing 4k videos. However misses the mark for gaming.

Really wish Xbox would bring out there own console which is optimised for Xbox.

B091FSJGTP,nitin tugnawat,5.0,Value for money,18 August 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"### Lenovo ThinkPad T470 Review

The Lenovo ThinkPad T470 is a solid, business-class laptop that offers a perfect blend of performance, durability, and portability. As a member of Lenovo's esteemed ThinkPad line, the T470 continues the tradition of robust build quality, exceptional keyboard experience, and reliable performance, making it an ideal choice for professionals and business users.

Design and Build Quality
The T470 maintains the classic ThinkPad aesthetic with its all-black, boxy design. While the look is somewhat understated, it exudes professionalism. The build quality is impressive, with a sturdy magnesium-reinforced chassis that can withstand daily wear and tear. The laptop's hinge is well-designed, allowing the screen to open",6
B091FSJGTP,Amazon Customer,5.0,Great value and fantastic support,3 January 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"I bought this laptop in July last year and wanted to wait a bit before posting a review.
Firstly, when I received the laptop, I couldn't believe it was refurbished; it looked brand new!
It has worked flawlessly ever since and battery life is ample.
I recently tried to use the HDMI port and found it wasn't working and contacted Amazon. I got an immediate call back from Amazon who put me in touch with Loop8. I got a reply within the hour and my issue was a simple Graphics driver update that windows had somehow managed to delete!
With a new driver installed, the HDMI port is working fine.
I had already recommended this company to a friend who was also looking for a laptop and was very impressed with mine. I would have no hesitation in recommending this company and it's support to anyone looking to refurbished laptop.",8
B091FSJGTP,Rittik,4.0,Quality control needed from sellers,13 February 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"I received a excellent piece of laptop, no scratches, fantastic display, original charger.
However, it wont turn on without the charger. On checking further found that the internal battery is not detected and the external battery wont charge at all. Contacted the seller and they immediately accepted the return with a full refund. Seller was co-operative all throughout the refund and return process and I must say they have excellent customer service.
I would advise the sellers(s) to do a quality and health check of the laptops before they are despatched from their hub to avoid such inconveniences.",18
B091FSJGTP,Julie P.,1.0,"This is the first, and last time...",3 December 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"When this computer came, the battery life was very poor. I ordered a new battery, which was sent. But upon opening the back, there was only ONE battery in the device, which requires two separate batteries!
Whomever 'refurbished' the unit neglected to even install the second battery!! I went through customer service, and a second battery was sent...but it was the incorrect one. Amazon provided a partial refund so I could order the proper one myself. I did and when it was installed, the screws that were meant to hold this battery in place weren't there. When the computer was more closely inspected, it became obvious that those were not the only screws missing. Now, with two new batteries in place, they are still not holding a charge. Obviously, the device has a short somewhere that is draining the batteries. This device was 'inspected by Amazon' and came with paperwork to indicate that everything was fine. It is not. It can't be used unless it is plugged in, because it dies within 35 - 40 minutes. Useless!",7
B091FSJGTP,Elliot,5.0,Amazing laptop!,4 May 2025,the United Kingdom,False,"Amazing laptop! i bought this mainly for light gaming (tf2 etc) and social media, and just daily driver stuff, and it has held up really well! its moderately fast on opera gx so itl be fine if you are just looking for a ""netbook"" the sound is crisp, and clean, its easy to use only issue i have had is the Ram (memory) its perfectly fine for google and whatnot, but im personaly going to upgrade to 16 gb.It did arrive a few days late, but thats mainly due to DPD being slow",0
B091FSJGTP,Thomas Miller,5.0,Very nice refurb!,1 October 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"Screen has a small mark which you don't notice during regular use as advertised. What amazed me was finding the external battery had 99% capacity left which I take it means they've given me a new battery and as I understand, those aren't cheap to buy so definitely a huge pro for this company. Internal battery has 81% capacity left as well.

What really got me was finding out the laptop has a NVMe drive instead of the standard sata and that is a really nice touch. Another great find after opening the laptop was the 8gb of ram is just coming from one stick which gives a very simple upgrade path with the addition of a second stick should you need it which should also improve system responsiveness should I need it in the future.

I could tell these guys are very experienced with the way they've cleaned up the fans and the rest of the insides of the laptop as well. That definitely wins extra points from me since it shows they've looked inside and made sure there's nothing that could effect performance like excess dust and debris which effects temperatures or increases static risk to the unit.

Forgot to mention packaging this arrived in, it was a decent sized cardboard box and the laptop was inside an inflated soft shell which is easily slides out of on delivery. I wish more companies would use those for shipping new laptops, let alone a refurb.

The only thing which doesn't win points is the pack of Haribo but it is a very nice touch which did make me smile

Overall, very impressed with the laptop and the company I purchased from. Will definitely check them out again in the future if I'm in the market for any upgrades

B07NZ679B8,M Ion,5.0,Excellent,29 September 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"I purchased the product in ""like new"" condition, and it arrived exactly as described! There wasn’t a single blemish, and everything works perfectly. The screen quality is fantastic, and the performance has been smooth. The battery has also been great so far, lasting me a full day of work without any issues.

I was initially hesitant to buy it because of some negative reviews I read online, mentioning concerns like overheating, fan noise, and poor battery life. However, given the great price, I decided to take the chance—and I'm glad I did! I haven't experienced any of those problems. The laptop runs quietly, stays cool even during intensive tasks, and the battery life has been solid. It feels just as good as new.

This is my first time buying a refurbished product, and I’m genuinely impressed. Definitely recommend!",10
B07NZ679B8,Beyondizm,5.0,Great Value MacBook – Works Like New,12 February 2025,the United Kingdom,False,"I was a bit skeptical about buying a renewed MacBook Air, but this one exceeded my expectations! It arrived in excellent condition, with no noticeable scratches or damage, and works flawlessly.

The Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, and 128GB SSD provide smooth performance for everyday tasks like browsing, streaming, and light work. The battery life is still solid, and macOS runs fast and responsive.

For the price, this is a fantastic deal—highly recommended for anyone looking for a budget-friendly MacBook that still performs great",3
B07NZ679B8,Tom Guise,5.0,Impressively refurbished MacBook – feels like a new one,7 June 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"I bought a 2017 MacBook Air for my father from Once ClickCrazy Deals, through Amazon's Renewed Guarantee. I have owned many Macs in my lifetime, but never purchased a refurbished one before, and for the price (which was excellent) I was expecting a computer that looked like a used machine, but it looks and feels, to all intents and purposes, to be brand new. I was really impressed with what I received. Although it doesn't come in the official box, it is carefully packaged in a shockproof bubble sleeve and sturdy brown box, which is more than fine. The aluminium shell is unscratched (I feel they may buff them out or even replace the case – hard to tell, but looks great), the keyboard is definitely brand new (no shiny or faded keys, and they feel clean and responsive) and I believe it is a proper Apple keyboard, there are no marks on the screen at all. The computer software has been restored to factory settings. Most impressively, the battery feels as good as new and runs for days (so likely also new). Macs have a long lifespan, and I feel that this computer has many years of good use in it. One more thing – the MagSafe charging cable that came with it was also new, but the UK adaptor that clips to it had a slight fault – it crackled when plugged in (this part wasn't an official Apple part, but it is just a plug). However, when I contacted the vendor to explain it, they responded to me within half an hour and sent a new component out by the next day – so the customer service is also top-notch. I feel very happy with my purchase and reassured by this whole experience and would definitely buy from them again.",16
B07NZ679B8,Robert,5.0,Like Brand New,23 January 2025,the United Kingdom,False,Excellent condition as the seller described. Looks brand new and is very responsive. The battery seems to last well for an old laptop. Only put it on charge when watching videos or power hungry apps. Came with a brand new charger ( not official apple charger) but does the job well. For the money this has turned out to be a great deal.,0
B07NZ679B8,Amazon Customer,5.0,Exactly as described,23 December 2024,the United Kingdom,False,Arrived very well packaged with a brand new replacement power supply/charger. Great laptop at a great price and the service was wonderful. No damage to laptop and arrived clean and ready to use.,0
B07NZ679B8,MJ,1.0,Damaged & non-working battery. Returning item.,23 April 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"I had high hopes for this item, but unfortunaely it did not live up to the ""excellent"" standard it was sold at and I am returning it under the Amazon Renewed Guarantee - this is a supplier failure, not an iem failure. MAC KING has supplied an untested, damaged, faulty item. So buyer beware from this seller.

In terms of physical damage, there were 3 marks (one dent on the top cover, 2 heavy scratches on the inner case) that were visible from several metres away, so visual damage condition is average at best. I was willing to overlook cosmetic damage, but unfortunately the item doesn't work.

The item battery at new is 12hrs ish. In ""excellent"" condition, it is supposed to retain 80% of that. It is clear this device hasn't been tested as promised at all. The battery level either remains at 100% and then it suddenly dies after approximately one hour, or the battery life trickles down to about 70% and then it dies. Upon switching on, it shows the ""battery dead"" sign. So basically this device is like playing Russian roulette - you don't know when it's going to die but its definitely going to. Which is none too helpful when you need to use the item!

In addition, it was supplied with a damaged charger (dented on the port end somehow!). So all in all, whilst the price is good for an excellent condition 2017 Mac, er... that's not what I received.

I'm really frustrated as it took hours to set the thing up, and has taken hours of trying to fix this issue with software updates and going down the google rabbit hole. To have to wipe it, send it back, and then find another solution and start again.... I'm none too thrilled by. What a giant waste of time - thanks Mac King. I am grateful for the Amazon renewed guarantee, because I am sending this item back to MAC KING the seller, hopefully for a full refund as promised by Amazon, and will try another supplier.

It was very easy to set up; follow the instructions and you cannot go wrong. Its a lot different from my old Acer which i had for 10 years, hope this one lasts as long.
Still configuring everything to my personal tastes, that will take me a while.
I plumped for a Samsung as i have always used their phones and have never had a problem. I love how the laptop links to my phone and how i can answer texts and calls from the laptop. Its very useful when on sites where they need to send you verification codes to your phone. Messages pop up on the laptop so you dont have to search the phone for the message and code, its just there in front of you.

B0DNK1WFV6,ur_sine_nomine,5.0,What an improvement in ChromeOS hardware and software!,9 March 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"After about seven years since I last used ChromeOS, I decided to have another go as my existing desktop machine was getting old and I was becoming tired of its high power usage, its quirks and, really, the need to be a system manager.

That turned out to be an excellent idea as ChromeOS has come on by miles since then in both hardware and software. I went for this particular Chromebook as it was discounted by £60 and has had consistently good reviews, which turned out to be justified.

First, Lenovo's hardware. It is a ""Chromebook Plus"", a new Google initiative which, in practice, means a 12th-generation Intel CPU or newer, sufficient memory, a large SSD rather than the slow eMMC storage often used on Chromebooks, and a HD screen. Chromebook Plus is a good idea as Chromebooks have modest hardware requirements but, in the past, those led to over-enthusiastic cost-cutting and damaged the brand.

This Chromebook has 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD and a 1920x1080 screen (non-touch) which is good - bright with small bezels at the side and slightly bigger ones top and bottom. It also has an N305 processor, which is 13th generation Intel so effectively current (14th generation processors were notionally released in January 2024 but machines based on them started becoming available in April) and, as it turns out, more than sufficient. (It is described as an ""i3"" but I would put it as a bit below that, not that I have found any performance issues). There is a fan, but it is rarely on. In fact, nothing gets hot in my experience.

The case is two-tone metal on the top, plastic on the bottom and astonishingly robust, even stronger than my work laptop which cost about five times as much. There is not the slightest give. Even the screen hinges are solid.

The keyboard is excellent - large keys (a benefit of ChromeOS, which removes redundant keys) with white backlighting, bright and evenly lit and a little light leakage on the top row only. The keys have a distinct action and feel good; I was able to put aside my mechanical keyboard, which is rare as I normally have to use it because laptop keyboards tend to feel dead. I use a mouse rather than a touchpad, so cannot comment on the second.

The camera is 1080p = 1920x1080 resolution (another Chromebook Plus stipulation and unusual - even on high-end laptops the resolution still tends to be 720p = 1280x720) and gives an image which is bright and without much noise even in poor light. There is a tiny privacy slider built into the case but, unfortunately, no LED to show that the camera is on.

The sound and microphone quality are good. In fact, I forgot to switch to my HDMI monitor's speakers and didn't notice for some time because the built-in sound is loud.

There is one USB-C port, two USB-A ports, a HDMI port and a headphone socket. The USB-C port is used for power so, if you want a free USB-C port, you will either have to keep switching cables or buy a USB-C hub. Some reviews are negative about this, but I prefer USB-A and HDMI because it is going to be a long time before everything uses USB-C and an external hub gives far more ports than a laptop ever could. The USB-A ports are stiff, but that will ease over time.

The only real hardware weakness is the power adapter which is a brick, albeit a relatively small and light one. I replaced it with a 65W Anker adapter and matching USB-C cable, which is much less obtrusive.

The Chromebook charges in short order - full charging takes roughly two hours to go from 50% to 100% using the Anker adapter - and the battery life is huge - I would say well over a working day, say 11-13 hours. There is a LED next to the USB-C port which is orange when charging and green when charged. A recent borrow from Android is adaptive charging, which is less hard on the battery than always charging at full tilt to 100%.

As hinted earlier handling of my second monitor (Dell 2K) is perfect - ChromeOS always knows when it is plugged and when it is not, and there is no nonsense like the configuration suddenly being forgotten.

ChromeOS? There is no question that it is a full operating system now and ""get a proper computer"" is outdated. It does everything I would expect. It is really three operating systems in one:

ChromeOS
Android
Linux

(Windows is in effect out of scope as installing it is a bad idea - the Chromebook must be put in developer mode via a number of hidden keypresses, which is inadvisable anyway as it weakens system protection, then there is a risky series of steps to replace the firmware which involve opening the case, temporarily removing an internal battery, and running a script from the Linux terminal).

It is perfectly viable only to use ChromeOS facilities, but the others add a lot.

ChromeOS provides the basic desktop, windows, Launcher, Shelf (task bar), System Tray with menu and applications (Chrome Apps), starting with Chrome itself and including a file manager, a text editor, a terminal and various others. The user interface animations are well done - attractive without being flashy or excessive. There are all the configuration options one would expect and some unusual ones including a full keyboard remapper. It is surprising how keyboard-centric ChromeOS has become: there is a very useful Key Shortcuts application which gives all the possible key presses and combinations - and there are dozens. It has some excellent implementations of standard features such as Desks (multiple desktops) and Overview, which has a dedicated key on the top row. Another dedicated key makes the current window full screen, and the Caps Lock key has been replaced by an Everything key (as Google calls it) which opens the Launcher and has a number of other functions when escaped. There is no dedicated search key; press Everything and start typing into the field at the top of the Launcher (""Search your images, files, apps and more"").

Android is integrated - Google Play is present and can be used to install apps which appear as icons in the Launcher. The only problem I have seen is that most Android apps solely support a phone screen size; some support tablet size and a very few have a free choice of screen size. Unfortunately, the chosen size is not remembered on reboot and reverts to phone. As it turns out, Adobe Reader supports full screen and is a much better PDF reader than Gallery, the inbuilt app, which has bugs.

(As there is not long to go, it is worth noting that Chrome Apps will be phased out in January 2025, so after that it'll be Android or Linux applications only plus Progressive Web Apps - in other words, Web sites which offer an option to be installed and may be run from the Launcher or the Shelf via an icon).

Linux is supported by a container which is not installed by default so must be downloaded and installed, taking 10GB of space by default or more if chosen. It provides a Debian 12 environment with security updates coming from Debian, not (thankfully) some Google take on them. Again, Linux applications appear in the Launcher. A quirk is that sudo is required where one would expect in desktop Linux but there is no super user password.

Frankly, Linux support is not as good as that for Android in ChromeOS and has some issues:

- The whole subsystem occasionally crashes, although it does come back after a few minutes.

- Graphical applications are hard to get working because Debian uses Wayland and the implementation is shaky. That said, Firefox works straight off. By default it is the relatively obscure ESR version (intended for corporate use as it remains unchanged for several months rather than four weeks, only receiving security fixes in that period), an eccentricity of Debian, but Mozilla has recently implemented a repository supporting the release, beta and nightly versions which can be set up with a few commands.

- I could not get flatpaks to work. Despite appearances flatpaks are technically complex to implement and there are masses of tweaks and configurations online to try to get them running; I decided to skip those and install everything the old-fashioned way using .deb files.

- Applications can only see files written by Linux; those written by ChromeOS or Android must be copied into the Linux folder tree. (ChromeOS and Android can see each other's files, and Linux files).

- Applications don't follow the ChromeOS theme so have to be switched manually between light and dark.

- Some applications (e.g. Firefox ESR but not standard Firefox) appear slightly fuzzy.

The (ChromeOS) file manager has to cope with three operating systems plus Google Drive (four different home folders!) and does it well - it is clear which operating system's files you are accessing and just about anything can be cut and pasted between anywhere; for example, a URL in the Firefox (Linux) address bar can be cut and pasted into the Chrome address bar.

One niche, but surprising, integration is that, if you set up an Android VPN app, the VPN is shared with ChromeOS and Linux. That was about a hundred times easier than the three different configurations I was expecting.

One of the best things about ChromeOS is updates. To simplify, ChromeOS is split into two instances. An update is not a patch; it is a full instance of ChromeOS which the Chromebook reboots from after downloading. If it works, the first instance is deleted; if it fails, the second instance is deleted and the first instance is rebooted from. The configuration and user files are separate and linked to the current instance. This ""A-B update"" is so much better than Windows' method of inserting patches into a single, increasingly put-upon instance with the configuration and user files mixed up in it.

I switched to the beta version of ChromeOS out of interest. It is solid and entirely suitable for day-to-day use but unfortunately, like most vendors, Google is bad at writing change logs so it is hard to work out the changes in the latest beta. At least it is clear what version the machine is running, as there is a ""bug"" icon in the System Tray and ""Beta"" followed by the version number is permanently displayed in the System Tray menu. Beta is updated roughly every week; it is possible to move to more frequent builds (release > beta > development) without a powerwash (factory reset), but moving in the opposite direction requires a powerwash.

Finally, an old complaint - short support times for ChromeOS - has been tackled definitively by Google; Settings > About ChromeOS > Additional Details states that there will be updates here until June 2033.

Overall, I am tremendously impressed with this Chromebook and with ChromeOS. Although its simplicity was the point of moving to it I had some hesitation as I was expecting rough edges which, ultimately, don't exist except with Linux. The speed of the desktop and, in particular, Chrome is remarkable compared to my Windows 11 laptop which is on paper far more powerful, and the difference in shutdown and reboot durations is almost embarrassing although the Chromebook only need be rebooted following an update. The only big shortcoming is that the ChromeOS desktop has no function - it merely shows the wallpaper which, admittedly, by default is a pleasant dynamic scene changing with the time of day. Files or shortcuts cannot be put on it. There are some smaller issues, such as the sleep time being fixed (no user setting), window tiling being simplistic (half-screen only) and there being no means of hiding icons in the Launcher, and also some visual inconsistencies - most of ChromeOS uses Material Design 3, with neat effects such as highlight colours being derived from the current wallpaper, but there are parts lagging behind including, oddly, Chrome itself. No doubt these will improve in time.

I paid £280. That is simply outstanding value for what is strangely classified in reviews as a low- to medium-range laptop. Five stars.

B09YHHV9K4,Jonathan's Dad,5.0,A Very Thin and Lightweight Small Laptop,4 May 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"The laptop is costimatically perfect with the exception of a few faint smudges at the bottom otherwise you’d be forgiven for thinking that it’s new. Either the previous owner have rarely/never used it or Microdream have done a damn good job at refurbishing it.

The laptop was pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro. Given the age of the laptop, I’m pretty sure that it was originally pre-installed with Windows 10 so Windows fans should be pleased because if nothing else, it proves that the X280 spec is high enough to run Windows 11. The laptop also comes with a free 1 year ESET Antivirus subscription. The ESET subscription can be renewed at c£30 p.a. I did have a bit of problem setting up the ESET Antivirus software but the ESET Helpdesk was very helpful so I’m now a very satisfied customer.

The 8th generation 4-core Intel i5 cpu seems pretty decent considering its age. It was able to handle anything I throw at it including video editing. I have not tried encoding videos with it yet but I suspect that ‘making a cup of tea’ while it is doing the hard work may not be enough. One small caveat is that the 8GB of RAM is not expandable because it is soldered onto the board! This is not a big deal for me because 8GB is pretty adequate for my use.

I can see myself taking the X280 with me in my next overseas trip as it is no more heavier or thicker than a tablet. If you’re looking for a small lightweight laptop with decent power for everyday use, look no further. I highly recommend this laptop.

B09YHHV9K4,S Bibble,4.0,A perfect secondary device,5 September 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"The reason I am removing a star is because it came pre-installed with Google Chrome. I don't like having spyware preinstalled on my computers. But it *didn't* come installed with the Lenovo drivers for adjusting the brightness etc, which should absolutely be on there. You can solve this by searching ""lenovo x280 drivers"". Apart from that, 5/5. Onto the real review...

I really don't know why anyone would even consider any other laptop at this price point unless they needed more RAM. Unfortunately it is impossible to upgrade it to 16GB due to it being soldered, but apart from that this is a fantastic laptop that's perfect for what I need it for - Microsoft Word, classic 1993 Doom and remote access mainly. I always go for and recommend refurbished ThinkPads and, in terms of condition, this one could've been described as new without the box. The keyboard, and per usual with this brand, is fantastic.

The thermals can be a bit fussy - when I was debloating W11 and installing several programs at once it got uncomfortably hot on my lap, but that is to be expected in this form factor. I simply started using it on a simple slab of varnished wood. It would have been nice to have a cheaper option that comes without a Windows license, especially if you happen to have one already or would prefer to use an alternative OS, but eh, for £200 you DEFINITELY can do A LOT worse.

In a way it reminds me of the old netbooks that were fashionable about 10-15 years ago now, except it's got enough horsepower and a good enough keyboard to be useful!

B09YHHV9K4,Arikans,5.0,Excellent value for money,18 May 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"I rarely write reviews, but this one deserves it. This is a great little machine that does exactly what I need: a thin client with enough CPU and RAM to allow me to have meetings, browse documentation and use much more powerful computers remotely.
I believe it would be adequate for office work and even some software development if I needed to use it for those purposes. Lenovo's decision to use soldered RAM is unfortunate, 16GB would have given this laptop a much longer lifetime. I successfully used this to drive two 24"" external monitors, using the usb-c port with an usb-c to hdmi cable. That port is thunderport capable so it could also do display port output with 60hz at 4K, but that's not what I need/have at the moment.
Beware though: this machine is using a special ethernet port Lenovo saw fit to use, and the adapter sold by Lenovo is so large it block the usb-c port, so you can't have ethernet port and two external monitors in use at the same time if you use that port (I do). I bought a usb to ethernet adapter for the other regular usb 3 port and it worked just fine.
The machine arrived in great condition, so thanks to the seller. For £230 or so, this is great value for money. I installed win 10 even though it arrived with a clean (no bloatware) windows 11 install. I must say that getting windows 10 on this machine took some effort even though drivers are available from Lenovo. I think it would have been easier if I installed the desktop app Lenovo provides for driver installation/management, so you may want to try that first.
Finally, 12"" IPS panel with 1920*1080 looks really, really nice. Almost like looking at a tablet, so I'm happy I did not go with a laptop with smaller resolution. Lenovo has its own weird habits, such as being unable to disable fast charging of the battery, or not being able to stop the laptop from automatically starting if someone lifts the lid after hibernation (does not happen if you shut down), but I can live with these.

Overall, excellent value for money.

B08DRC16QM,DEBORAH BAIRD,1.0,Laptop came un-updated and with tracking apps,14 April 2025,the United Kingdom,False,"The laptop's exterior matched the listed expectation - an excellent refurb - with only minor scratches and damage to the outside. However, that is the only positive, as the laptop's interior workings are very poor. It would not even run a low graphic game that has little demand on the system. We had to get a local computer guy to look at the laptop, and he discovered not only were half of the drives not installed on the laptop, but it still had a tracking program activated from when it was - assumed to be - previously used as a laptop for a company or business. Additionally, the fan does not work, contributing to the performance issues and lag. When the laptop is turned on, the fan does not activate, meaning there is either an issue with the fan's internal circuitry or an issue with the motherboard, meaning that the fan is not getting powered. The only fix would be to attempt to replace the fan and motherboard, but at that point, it would be more cost-effective to get another laptop entirely.

When I first turned the laptop on after receiving the package, I had to install around 15 security updates. This was meant as a gift, but it did not meet the expectations and information provided, not even being able to run games that the device itself says it can handle and is compatible with.

I will be returning the laptop and asking for a full refund.

All fantastic, if it had actually worked.

Powered it up and it went to the boot options menu and the only option was to boot from LAN.

Not good. Checked in BIOS and there was no mention of a hard disk.

So, I contacted Amazon and they told me to contact the seller, a Microsoft Approved refurbisher. The seller told me to contact Amazon and, at this point, I decided to investigate the problem myself.

On removing the battery and the base, I found that the SSD was just not connected. In fact, had I turned the laptop upside down, the SSD would have fallen out because it didn't have the expected collar, which allows it to be screwed to the motherboard.

Connected the SSD and it booted fine. I've now trashed Windows and installed Linux, so I guess my warranty is probably void.

Raises the question about who is responsible when duff goods are delivered: Amazon or the seller?

It's a great machine but, for this to happen demonstrates rather slip-shod refurbishment and, also, pretty poor customer service on the part of both Amazon and the seller.

B08BWQF2B9,Reader23,1.0,"No Bluetooth. No working jackplug. Debacle trying to sort it out. Measly ""partial refund""",27 July 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"Was sold as in ""excellent condition"", but had no Bluetooth installed despite being sold as with Bluetooth and additionally the jackplug did not work, so no means of sound outside the system speakers. I live abroad and had brought this over in UK. I was happy to get it back over to the UK for an exchange or repair, but they said they could not send it back anywhere outside the UK, so I now realise my warranty is as good as useless. I had no choice but to put up with a jackplug that does not work and buy a Bluetooth key for it and ask for a partial refund for selling a faulty item. They offered a shockingly cheap 20 pound partial refund. When I said this was not appropriate compensation, they offered me an extra.... five pounds?Meanwjhile this all took about two weeks of waiting on replies to messages, and backing and forthing. Utter debacle and I'll never buy a recon ever again.

As an edit: Reading through reviews, it seems having no Bluetooth is quite common, so not a one off ""mistake"" either. .",3

The touchscreen is incredibly responsive, making navigation smooth and effortless. A great processor, with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD, super fast performance, whether I'm multitasking.

Despite being renewed, it looks and works like new, with no noticeable wear or issues. Windows 10 Pro runs flawlessly, and the webcam is clear for video calls. Battery life is also impressive, lasting through a full workday, i forgot my charge at home and it the battery was enoght for all day.

I bought it on offer for £395. It also has 16GB rather than just 8GB. The seller's customer service is excellent as well. The touchscreen is so responsive, vibrant and precise. The mouse pad is totally accurate and smooth. The sound is amazing. The keyboard is backlit and feels natural to use. It has loads of ports. My model did not come with a SIM slot for a data SIM but that was no problem. I bought an unlocked usb dongle and it works fantastically. I watched a few YouTube videos about this laptop before I bought it and was very impressed with all the features. It has fingerprint recognition, pin and password to choose from for logging in.

B08BWQF2B9,Frank J.,2.0,Didn't expect it to be skinned,16 January 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"I feel a bit conflicted about writing this review. The laptop itself works fine and as long as you don't mind having the absolutely latest spec components then it's really good value. However, mine arrived with a faux aluminium vinyl covering on the lid which I assume has been added to hide cosmetic damage on the lid. It's not obvious at first glance, but it's definitely basically a big sticker applied over the original lid and I can only guess at what blemishes it's hiding underneath. Given that they seem to make a big deal of the cosmetic aspects in the main description - ""This product works and looks like new."" and ""No signs of cosmetic damage (scratches, dents, etc.) will be visible when the product is held 30 centimetres away"" - to my mind, they're strongly implying that the laptop has had hardly any wear. But the addition of a vinyl covering (on mine at least) makes me wonder if that's a little bit of a misleading impression and that they'll just basically use a big sticker over any scuffs and scratches. Digging far deeper into the ""What is Amazon Renewed?"" section, I can see that they say ""Some laptops may arrive with designs (laptop skins) on the outside of the device"" so I guess they've covered themselves (pun intended). But it all feels a little bit misleading and disingenuous. At the end of the day, I'm not overly bothered that the laptop is skinned, I'm just feeling misled, hence the 2 star review.",23

B0CMQM6977,Simon,4.0,Don't trust the description of items when buying refurbished.,7 February 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"My experience of Lenovo and, in particular, the T490 laptops is that they are good, reliable workhorses when they are set up properly. They are Windows 11 compatibile, which will become very relevant when support for Windows 10 runs out in October 2025. This is an important consideration when buying refurbished laptops because what looks like a bargain may not be a bargain if you have to replace it next year. Hence, I opted to buy a refurbished model with Windows 11 Pro already installed.

You can get a much higher spec machine for your money buying a refurbished laptop that is a few years old but it appears, from my experience, that you have to be wary of the claims made regarding features and condition in the product descriptions. There are many different variants of the T490 and the laptop that arrived did not match the descriptions in several material respects: (1) In the description the claims made about cosmetic condition were: ""Body: light scratches, clearly visible when holding the device 30 centimeters away and perceptible to touch."" The laptop I received had a sheet of plastic glued to the lid, presumable to cover gouges, scratches, and/or cracks, and had a poorly executed cutout to allow the logo and LED on the lid to be seen. (2) In the description of the item, the claim was made that the laptop had ""enhanced security with a fingerprint reader"" but this version of it had no fingerprint reader. (3) The laptop was not fully functional as delivered because there were Windows Security issues.

There were problems with Window 11 Pro, as installed, that meant some of the ""enhanced security"" was not functional. Windows Security was not showing ANY device security features. Device encryption was turned on, which is the default for Windows 11 Pro installations, but no decryption key was available and there was no warning to suggest encryption was suspended pending keys being backed up. I therefore had to turn off device encryption to avoid issues down the line. The TPM attestation and storage showed as not ready, so bitlocker could not be used on a per. drive basis.

A considerable amount of effort was required to sort out the issues with Windows Security and ensure the device now met the requirements for standard hardware security. After reinstalling Windows 11, the device encryption option disappeared because there were unallowed DMA capable buses/devices detected. However, the TPM attestation and storage were showing as ready and bitlocker could now be used for drive encryption if required.

Now that the issues with the operating system appear to have been rectified, this does look like a reasonably well provisioned laptop that should give a few years of service. The failure to accurately describe the cosmetic state of the machine is an annoyance, but does not appear to impact on functionality. However, the end user should be able to rely on the descriptions regarding cosmetic state, features, and functionality when buying refurbished items on Amazon. If the device is sold as fully functional, it should be fully functional without the degree of end user intervention that was required in this case. Hence, the descriptions of refurbished items should not be trusted.

As a final point, I found out that the laptop I received was originally purchased in Finland. There was nothing in the description of the item to suggest it may have originated outside the UK.

B07GCRHS5V,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,11 March 2020,the United States,False,"I bought this laptop for use in my new home-based business. My old computer was slow. This one is amazingly fast, and I love that it has Windows 10 Pro. I have seen this same computer listed at Walmart for $1500, and this computer has everything I need. Setup and update was the fastest and easiest I have ever experienced on any computer.

I have only had this for a few days, so I'm sure I will discover even more features as time goes by, but for now, here are my favorite things about this computer.

<ul>
<li>It works flawlessly with a second monitor hooked up to it</li>
<li>It has a 10-key option built into the keyboard. If you hold down the Fn button on the left side of the keyboard, you can use the 10-key function with your right hand. I thought about attaching a second keyboard to this so I would have 10-key, but now I don't have to. </li>
<li>The power cord plugs into the back instead of into the side, which just works out better for me. </li>
<li>This computer is lightning fast. I can have 10 or more open tabs on my web browser, and it doesn't slow down a bit! </li>
<li>I don't know what it is about it, but the touchpad just feels nicer and seems easier to use. The surface of the touch pad and the area around it is textured. Maybe this is what makes it easier. Also, the buttons are where you can see them, rather than hidden within the touch pad. </li>
<li>Mine does have a backlit keyboard, but do be aware that this is a luck-of-the-draw feature. Not all of these will have that. </li>
<li>The battery life seems to be really long. I have not used it away from my desk much, but during the few times that I have left it unplugged for a few hours, I noticed very little drain on the battery compared to my old laptop.</li>
<li>The picture is very high-quality. I have a second monitor hooked up to it, which is also brand new, and other than the monitor being larger, I do not discern any difference in the picture quality.</li>
</ul>

I will say it would have been nice if it had a touch-screen, but with all this laptop's good features and qualities, I adapted very quickly to not having a touchscreen.

I am sure there are a lot of other things to love about this laptop, which I will discover over time. I will keep updating this review as I find more awesome features. I was a little nervous about getting a refurbished computer, but I am so glad I did. I never could have gotten this caliber of a computer within my budget, and it is what I needed. This is the best investment I have made into my new business so far.

I use this computer for office and business-related tasks. I put it through a pretty good load with a lot of multitasking during use, in ways my old laptop could not tolerate. It seems to have the resources to handle everything I throw at it. I was thinking I would just buy a lower-cost laptop for now, then get a more expensive one once I get my business off the ground, but this one is a keeper!

I do not know how this would perform for gaming, as I am not a gamer and have never tried any gaming. I just know it has everything I wanted in a laptop for business needs. If you need a computer for work or just for general everyday use, I highly recommend this one.

B08R2WTNQ6,Wade,5.0,"Great product, excellent condition",4 January 2025,the United Kingdom,False,"I’m very pleased. I was nervous of spending over £500 on a used machine, especially one four years old, but it’s almost immaculate, with just one tiny little scratch on the cover, of about 3 or 4mm. Battery health is at 98% which is great for the age.

Never used Mac or MacBook before, and I’m blown away by its capabilities. The Apple Intelligence is brilliant, and the trackpad is genuinely useful - so many useful gestures/shortcuts at the swipe or pinch of the fingers. And I love the fingerprint reader access.

It’s possibly slightly slower than my gaming pc, but that has 64mb of ram and a 12gb GPU. This doesn’t mean the MacBook is slow, just that there’s a pause of a few seconds for Word to open, for example - it’s not instant. However, the fact that the machine is ready instantly when you open the lid more than makes up for that. No boot up time at all.

Setup was a doddle. Took an hour or so, but that was partly due to the downloading of updates.

It’s a lot of money to pay for a four year old machines but I have no regrets. Very good value for money.

B08R2WTNQ6,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,2 January 2025,Germany,False,"Titel: Der M1 MacBook Air – Unglaublich schnell und leistungsstark!

Bewertung: ★★★★★ (5 von 5 Sternen)

Ich habe das M1 MacBook Air nun seit einigen Monaten und bin absolut überwältigt von der Leistung dieses Geräts. Der Apple M1-Chip hat das Notebook auf ein völlig neues Level gehoben. Als langjähriger Mac-Nutzer kann ich ehrlich sagen, dass dies das schnellste und leistungsstärkste MacBook Air ist, das ich je benutzt habe.

Schon beim ersten Einschalten merkt man die Geschwindigkeit. Der Startvorgang dauert nur wenige Sekunden – das Gerät ist blitzschnell betriebsbereit, ohne dass man auf nervige Ladezeiten warten muss. Und das Beste daran: Es wird dabei nicht heiß oder laut. Der Lüfter läuft praktisch nie, was das M1 MacBook Air unglaublich leise macht. Dies ist besonders vorteilhaft, wenn man viel unterwegs arbeitet oder in ruhigen Umgebungen wie Cafés oder Bibliotheken ist.

Die Leistung ist beeindruckend. Selbst bei anspruchsvolleren Aufgaben wie Video-Bearbeitung, Bildbearbeitung oder mehreren gleichzeitig geöffneten Apps bleibt das MacBook Air absolut flüssig und reaktionsschnell. Apps öffnen sich in einem Bruchteil einer Sekunde, und ich habe nie das Gefühl, dass der Computer ins Stocken gerät. Auch die Akkulaufzeit ist außergewöhnlich – bei normaler Nutzung komme ich problemlos durch den Tag, und das, ohne ständig nach einer Steckdose suchen zu müssen. Bei geringerer Belastung kann der Akku sogar noch länger durchhalten.

Ein weiteres Highlight ist die Grafikkartenleistung des M1-Chips. Spiele und grafikintensive Anwendungen laufen auf diesem MacBook überraschend gut, was für ein ultradünnes Gerät dieser Größe außergewöhnlich ist. Die Integration von Hardware und Software funktioniert perfekt, und es gibt keinerlei Verzögerungen oder Ruckeln.

Insgesamt ist das M1 MacBook Air ein wahres Kraftpaket in einem ultraleichten, dünnen Design. Es ist die perfekte Wahl für alle, die ein schnelles, leistungsstarkes und zugleich äußerst tragbares Gerät suchen. Die Kombination aus Geschwindigkeit, Leistung und Akkulaufzeit macht es zu einem unschlagbaren Begleiter für den Alltag – egal, ob für die Arbeit oder Freizeit.

Fazit: Das M1 MacBook Air ist ein absolutes Meisterwerk von Apple. Wer ein schnelles, zuverlässiges und elegantes Notebook sucht, wird mit diesem Gerät definitiv nicht enttäuscht. Eine klare Kaufempfehlung!

B082P7XWMN,mike moreton,1.0,Cheap little laptop.,26 June 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"Used this for several hours now and found it to be mostly OK. Certainly fast enough for most routine tasks but probably not much use for CPU heavy games.The keyboard is pretty good but lacks a caps on light (see update).Some of the function keys have symbols on but don't actually seem to function! Screen is obviously at the cheaper end and definition isn't great. Tried a 4k video on YouTube ( screen is only HD) and there wasn't any stuttering but the definition was pretty lacklustre. Not very good if you want to edit video. Bought this as renewed and the condition is fine. No power light to tell you it's charging when switched off. Overall it's reasonably good value for money and OK for routine stuff.

Update. September 2023.
Failed after 15 months. Won't power on even after charging for a couple of hours. Tried a load of ""solutions"" from Lenovo and Google but with zero success. Another expensive ""renewed"" paperweight.",6

B0D6YLBBZL,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,14 February 2025,the United States,False,"I bought this laptop because I wanted to try Windows on ARM, and because after buying two ThinkPads at work, I wanted to have a ThinkPad for my personal use. My expectations on Windows on ARM were low, but this thing has seriously overdelivered.

Hardware is nice and it does feel as solid as a ThinkPad should feel. Only gripe with the design is that it collects finger smudges like crazy. Battery life is beyond ridiculous, but this is expected. If you have never used an ARM-based laptop before, prepare to have your mind blown away by the battery life. Connectivity has worked to perfection with all my peripherals. Anything from an external SSD, a BluRay burner, and a large screen TV have worked without a single issue. Wi-Fi 7 has worked fine as well.

Software compatibility has been okay. Note that this is not a gaming laptop, and many games won't run well (or at all) on ARM computers. But so far, every piece of software I've needed to run either has a native ARM version, or runs well as an emulated x64 application. Emulated apps do run slower, but this Snapdragon processor is so fast already that the slowdown won't affect your daily usage. You will only notice the slowdown of emulated x64 apps if you are chasing benchmark numbers. Lenovo's bloatware is kept to a bare minimum. There is Commercial Vantage, where Lenovo tries to upsell you in warranty programs, but you can also use it to customize useful settings and download drivers and firmware updates, so it isn't what I'd call a useless app. All other bloatware comes from Microsoft as part of the Windows 11 installation. Speaking of Windows 11, it works exactly the same way it does on Intel or AMD processors, and everything is where you expect it to be. You have to dig into the Settings before you'll be able to tell this is an ARM-based computer. I have not used any of the AI Copilot+ features because I can't care less about them.

B0DR8NYF9V,Wajeeh,5.0,Great Handheld Console,29 April 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"The Legion Go is a great gaming handheld console, although not perfect.

Design:
The screen is beautiful and really good for watching movies, and the console's integrated kickstand makes it really easy to just prop the console up and enjoy.
The Legion Go has 2 USB C ports - one on the top and one on the bottom, which is really useful from a practicality perspective, especially when gaming as you're not restricted to one port for charging.
The trackpad is a very useful inclusion, and makes navigating Windows much easier.
The detachable joysticks are a really useful feature - you can prop up the display using the kickstand on a desk and use the detachable joysticks to game. It could be made better if there was some sort of accessory (similar to the Nintendo Switch) with which you could connect the two joysticks, as it does feel a little bit weird having two separate controllers.

Setup:
The Legion Go has Windows 11, which is a bit of a double-edged sword - you do get a lot more freedom as standard compared to the Steam Deck, especially as it is easier to use games from Xbox Game Pass, Epic Games, Ubisoft Connect etc., but it does come at the cost of the Legion Go being much less plug and play as compared to the Steam Deck.
On first use you should update Windows and all the drivers - Windows does auto-update on initial setup, however you should check for updates to ensure your device is up to date. Lenovo also has a handy auto-driver update tool on their website, which updates all drivers and even the BIOS, but still expect initial setup to take a couple of hours.

Legion Software:
This is an area where the Legion Go is a bit of a let-down, as it's software isn't as fleshed out as the Steam Deck or even the ROG Ally. If you are quite good with tech and setting up different settings etc., then you won't have an issue. but if you prefer having a more streamlined experience, then it may be better to look elsewhere.
Also, Lenovo has been slow to update drivers and software, especially compared to Asus with their ROG Ally, which is something you may want to keep in mind. Lenovo has however been quite active on social media in terms of communication, which is admirable.

Gameplay:
Gameplay is what you would expect from the Z1 extreme chip, and pretty much on par with other handhelds such as the ROG Ally which also have this chip. There's also plenty of guides online to optimise gameplay, such as changing the VRAM to 6GB in the BIOS. Obviously don't expect to game with settings cranked to max, but the Legion Go still provides a very respectable gaming performance.

Battery:
Battery life ranges from 1.5-3 hours depending on the game you are playing. If you are travelling, then I would highly recommend you invest in a large power bank capable of providing at least 60W of power.

Conclusion:
The Legion Go is a solid device and I am loving it so far, although it does have a few issues. However, it is my preference when compared to the Steam Deck and ROG Ally, mainly due to the detachable joysticks, kickstand, lovely screen and my preference for having Windows, despite the additional work it requires as compared to SteamOS.

B0DR8NYF9V,Amazon Customer,5.0,First handheld better than steam deck,7 March 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"After a few years having an obsession
with owning most handheld pcs and games consoles, nothing has really beaten the steam deck(and later the oled version) in terms of playability and ease of use thanks to not dealing with windows but this beast, with its amd ryzen z1 extreme and its big juicy 2k screen has made it worth it for me and its for a few reasons, first you can simply enter steam in big picture mode to have a ""console like experience"" but there's also the xbox pc app with all its gamepass games and lenovo have taken these, and others like ubisoft connect and epic store and put them all in one launcher that's accessed by a single button, a feature I never knew I needed and this,along with having all the performance settings at the press of another button are all reasons its worth buying and that's before considering the detachable ""joy-con"" controllers that can be combined with a (sadly seperately sold) adapter to make them into a traditional controller and of course the consoles party trick, the included adapter is a dock that can turn the right controller into a gaming mouse that, unsurprisingly is better for shooting games and makes it great for pc gamers,overall if you want to be able to play any current pc game with decent frame rate and graphics settings and wait the choice of console or mouse gaming, you won't find anything better yet and it will be a good few years before it's not worth gaming on at all.",0
B0DR8NYF9V,SD,1.0,Not an Xbox handheld,24 April 2025,the United Kingdom,False,"Been looking for an Xbox handheld to play all my Gamepass games.

This is not it unfortunately.

Set up
The is fairly easy and straightforward with lots of people who can help online from YouTube to forums.

Battery life 🔋
This was pretty awful. I got around 1h 15mins which I found shocking as it ment I was always plugged into a charger (which isnt very portable)

Build Quality ⭐
This is amazing, the screen the joycons and the case is amazing. It even has a little flap to allow you to change your computer when inside the case which is a great idea.

Gaming 🎮
I bought this to play Gamepass games but unfortunately it would kick you out in the middle of games, lag when moving around and was at times unplayable.

I really wanted to love the Legion Go.
The display is huge and crisp when playing 4k videos. However misses the mark for gaming.

Really wish Xbox would bring out there own console which is optimised for Xbox.

B09HYQWQ52,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,29 April 2022,the United States,False,"I'm not an average consumer, but a technical one who demands the best Windows laptop available, comparable to a desktop workstation and ""without breaking the bank"". This laptop perfectly met my needs. I bought it ""used like new"", but works like a charm. Super fast for serious software development, data processing (32GB helps a lot with memory-based data models), video/photo editing, and gaming. Lightweight compared to my previous 17-inch laptop, and the battery lasts for a fair amount of time. Having Windows to authenticate using just your finger is awesome (although I still need to educate my fingers to not hit the fingerprint/power button when my intention is hitting Delete). I also need to get used to the fact I don't have a numeric keyboard anymore like the one in my previous 17"" machine (still need to find a way to quickly get a weird ASCII character without using another keyboard). The metallic finish of the XPS series is really nice and looks very professional. The screen is very clear, and the speaker volume is quite good for a laptop. First, I was disappointed due to the fact I was getting black and white bars on the screen after closing the lid and opening it again (by next morning, or so). This was ocurring at least twice per week. I finally searched over the Internet and found a workaround as simple as deleting the video driver and letting the system install a new one by itself. This action downgraded the driver I believe, but completely solved the issue. Windows 11 works really well after performing an in-place upgrade during the initial boot. Having the PRO version of the OS is another plus. This machine didn't come with a dock or hub, as advertised (knew it might not come with it due to the used condition), and since *****ALL*****, I repeat, ****ALL**** my devices have just the classic/regular USB plug, having just newer USB-C ports is REALLY inconvenient. I work on at least 3 laptops all over the day, so I never use the touchpad mouse (to avoid discomfort and pain in my fingers or wrist). Have you seen a USB-C mouse or a flash drive around yet? Moreover, why purchasing others if the older are still very good? Then I solved the problem with a cheap $20 hub. USB OTG adapters for smartphones work very well either in case of emergency, like in my case. I might end up purchasing a better hub to have wired networking (due to speed), but let me say I haven't had the need so far as the wifi chip is working really fast in conjunction with my newest router....... in summary, this laptop worth every penny (and of course I got a big discount).

B09HYQWQ52,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,16 April 2022,the United States,False,"The seller is trustworthy. The renewed Dell 17"" laptop arrived in pristine condition, looking brand new.

I just finished setting up (free upgrade to Windows 11, downloaded virus protection, etc.) No problems.

Everything is working as expected. Although the laptop did heat up from installing Windows 11, it's cooling down now.

I need to explore and experience this new computer, of course, but I think I'm going to be a very happy camper!

May 28, 2022 Update: 5 stars to 3 stars

I have had this laptop for 3 months. Must tell you that the audio is crap. Surely the speakers are not original Dell. But who knows? It's a used, reconditioned laptop. I installed an audio app. It helped some, but the audio is still very poor.

I listen to dialogue, in movies and videos. Generally, audio speaker manufacturers use too much muffling & reverberation, in order to make music sound better, to fill the data gaps--which apparently get wider & wider every year. The quality decline is very noticable when you're just listening to someone talk. My 13"" HP Chromebook has a much clearer, better sound. The Toshiba Chromebook before that, was even better. Years ago, the original Amazon Fire tablet had tremendous sound.

When I observe this downward trend in audio quality. It makes me afraid to buy speakers, as a solution. (How crappy will THEY be?) Besides, I don't want to lug speakers around the house with a portable laptop.

This Dell XPS laptop is ok for productivity work. It is unpleasant for entertainment or to catch up on the news--I feel actual angry every time I hear muffled, garbled dialogue coming from ""under water.""

And now, I barely use this expensive Dell XPS laptop for research and writing--I haven't used it in 6 weeks! The 13"" Chromebook, which has better audio, is always on the kitchen table where I both work and ""play"" online.

Beyond this specific computer...

There is also worsening audio with my public library's audiobook delivery system, and Netflix DVDs.
So, maybe, are my ears going bad? I don't think that's the problem, because there are points when I can compare two devices or apps. For instance, right now. The HP Chromebook clearly beats the Dell XPS in audio quality. (Who would have thought? All the reviews praise the Dell XPS laptop for excellent audio.)

The decline is not in my ears. The decline is in the American standard of living. (BTW, all these audio manufacturers and media providers probably continue to sell the good-quality models to Europe and the rest of the world.)

---------------

I have now had this Dell laptop for 3 years. My Chromebook laptop, with much better audio, died. Now I have to use this Dell all the time. The audio is still disappointing (unnecessary reverberation and lack of clarity, thank god for captions). The battery dies within 2 hours. I am currently shopping for a new laptop. I will never buy another Dell again.

Had few scratches on the outside , but the laptop its self was fine. A bit noisy when in turbo mode . Gaming is smooth. Fast and cool looking laptop . Perfect for travelling while having fast laptop . Battery is fine in eco mode .",0
B0CZBVRSXT,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,12 August 2024,Mexico,False,"Compre esta laptop durante prime day por 26k pesos mexicanos, por ese precio es completamente imbatible y nada se le compara, aun con algo mas de precio vale mucho la pena.

Lo mejor:
-El rendimiento, sin ser absolutamente tope de gama en CPU/GPU para el tamaño que tiene es un monstruo, las RTX 4070 normalmente se encuentran en laptops mucho mas grandes y pesadas y tener el mismo rendimiento en formato pequeño es un plus, no creo que sea viable poner componentes mas potentes (y con mucho mas consumo) en un cuerpo tan pequeño, ya es top como esta.

-La versatilidad: esta laptop es muy ligera y pequeña, gracias al tamaño y a la potencia la puedes llevar facilmente en una mochila, pesa poco y cuando este desconectada usar como laptop para productividad o cosas ligeras, conectada para juegos, es todo terreno y tengo entendido que soporta cargadores USB C de unos 90w, aunque no he podido probarlo

-La calidad de construccion: esta laptop es casi completamente aluminio lo cual no es comun en laptop aun mucho mas caras, la calidad de construccion sin llegar a los niveles de macbook esta muy bien, ya podrian aprender otras marcas, que es una verguenza que laptops gamer de mucho mas precio tengan cuerpo mayormente de plastico

-El lector de huella y el teclado: otra cosa que normalmente no hay en laptops gamer (y menos a ese precio) me parece un punto a favor, el teclado sin ser una maravilla es bastante bueno y tiene iluminacion por tecla (no por zona), algo igualmente poco comun en laptops gamer de este precio

-La pantalla: Con miniled, una resolucion muy alta y HDR es una maravilla que ya quisieran laptops mucho mas caras, se ve excelente y llega a niveles casi de un macbook, la mejor pantalla no OLED del mercado, y con G Sync ufff, no podria pedir mas

Lo peor:
Que no se pueda ampliar la RAM: Tal vez sea por el tamaño que no permite slots DDR5 normales, pero la RAM esta soldada Y no es reemplazable, 16gb empiezan a ser normalitos y eso limita mucho la vida util de la laptop de aqui a unos años (y seguramente la descarta completamente patra ciertas tareas que requieran gran cantidad de memoria) una lastima que aqui no se venda la version de 32gb que si haria mucha falta, al menos el SSD SI es reemplazable...

La velocidad del puerto microsd: al principio me emocione al saber que tenia puerto micro sd ya que es facil ampliar la memoria y meter mas juegos y cosas, pero el puerto es bastante lento, me da velocidades de 12mb/s en memorias micro sd buenas de samsung, no me quiero imaginar como seria con memorias mas normales, es un puerto para musica y videos, y aun asi apenas alcanza para eso...

La bateria: sin ser mala esperaba que durara mas por 76w, unas 3 o 4 horas en ofimatica y web dependiendo de los settings que le pongas, una bateria de 80w haria que mejorara algo el tiempo y yo creo que el tamaño/peso seguiria sin ser problema, por supuesto olvidate de jugar algo que no sea 2d en bateria, la laptop no esta hecha para eso (como casi todas las laptop gamer)

El ruido: la laptop hace bastante ruido de ventilador en juegos, y aun en tareas sencillas en el modo rendimiento hace un pequeño siseo que podria resultar molesto, yo me acostumbre pero hay gente que podria encontrarlo muy molesto o insoportable

La salida de video USB C no esta conectada a la GPU: En otras laptops gamer que he tenido con mux switch en modo de solo GPU dedicada puedes conectar un monitor externo y hacer que este monitor este conectado directamente a la GPU para tener mejor rendimiento y activar G Sync/freesync, pues en esta laptop no, usar el modo de solo GPU dedicada DESACTIVA la salida de video por USB C (y te avisa por un mensaje) asi que el G sync solo funciona en la pantalla de laptop , es algo que nunca habia visto en ninguna otra laptop y no se si es por alguna limitacion tecnica, es una decepcion bastante grande para gamers mas hardcore, para el usuario normal no hay tanto problema, tal cual viene se puede conectar a monitores por USB C (o HDMI), pero como usa optimus y el monitor lo controla la dedicada de intel no tendra el maximo rendimiento en juegos (si no entendiste muy bien lo que comente no deberia preocuparte en absoluto)

En resumen es una excelente laptop, tiene caracteristicas muy top que se encuentran en modelos mucho mas caros a precio contenido, yo la compre en oferta pero aun valdria la pena si valiera 32k, aun por ese precio no hay casi nada mejor.

Recomiendo actualizar a la ultima bios de acer desde la pagina web en cuanto la tengan en las manos, las actualizaciones de bios son importantes y especialmente esta ya que mejora el soporte en las ultimas versiones de W11.

B0CZBVRSXT,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,31 March 2025,the United States,False,"During normal usage with power modes set to ""Best power efficiency"" or ""Balanced"" and the fan on ""Quiet"" or ""Balanced,"" the laptop remains extremely quiet. Thanks to its advanced lithography-based chip, energy consumption is remarkably low, with minimal performance impact from reduced voltage. Even after gaming, temperatures remain exceptionally low.

The main drawbacks are the limited port selection and soldered RAM. However, as long as you manage your workload efficiently—avoiding excessive multitasking during intensive tasks—performance remains stable. The lack of ports can be mitigated with a USB dock featuring HDMI and RJ45 Ethernet.

Overall, this laptop is a solid choice if the price aligns with your budget.",0
B0CZBVRSXT,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,18 August 2024,the United States,False,"I got the 14"" 4070 version, the pros are the screen is beautiful 1440p 250hz, HDR, the keyboard is the best part, looks gorgeous, great tactile feedback, good boot up times and the fingerprint scanner adds versatility.

You can pretty much game on high - ultra at 1440p and stay above 60 fps, or if you want more fps, you can lower the resolution at 1080p and get even more fps.

Things I don't like:

- Poor battery life: If you tune the settings, you can get at most 2 hours of battery, and if you like to get more performance on the go, you can probably get 1 hour and 20 mins.

- Gets really hot: when gaming, the aluminum under screen and the center of the keyboard can get so hot that sometimes you can not place your hand or fingers for too long.",0

B09T742JN3,Judge2,4.0,It's pretty good at the right price,25 May 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"Samsung NP750XED-KC1UK 15.6"" i3 12th Gen Intel 8GB RAM 256GB SSD Laptop. This mid-range offering from Samsung has a premium look and feel on account of it's attractively built and robust aluminium design. It has a decent direct lit (non IPS) LED screen which I would estimate a maximum brightness of about 250nits. The screen is adequate on maximum brightness and is non glossy so it's fine in bright environments indoors so long as you don't have a ton of sunlight shining on it. It also has fairly good viewing angles. The speakers are loud enough (which makes a welcome change) and the sound clear but lacking in bass as you might expect from a laptop. The speakers however are poorly positioned (on the underside of the chassis) so you lose some sound definition and quality if using it on your lap but work fine on a desk. You can't add RAM but can add an additional M.2 2280 SSD (up to 1TB) without replacing the existing one. The keyboard and trackpad are tactile and responsive with little to no discernable flex. The hexa-core Intel i3 1215U processor makes it quite snappy as a general everyday laptop. Occasionally the limitations of the 8GB LPX DD4 RAM which only runs at 2133 MHz can show with the odd freeze or unresponsive app. In terms of battery life, I managed to squeeze out a respectable if unspectacular 6-7 hours on maximum brightness surfing the web and doing office tasks. Ports included are: 1 HDMI, 2 USB Type-C, 2 USB3.2 Type-A, 1 MicroSD card slot and a headphone/mic combo. It's worth about the £299 I paid from another retailer but not the inflated price here. *Please note: some of the technical information about this laptop provided by Amazon is incorrect, this laptop does not have an AMOLED screen or allows the RAM to be expanded. You can find the correct information on the Samsung website using the model number.

If the laptop is on a nice flat surface then it's all good, the screen in my opinion is very clear I see some people complaining about the brightness etc but the only solution I can give to that problem is the obvious, and that is to basically turn the brightness up on the settings. Same goes for the volume, absolutely nothing wrong with it. Very convenient as you can use as a tablet or laptop, easily packable and discreet.

B08BLH2DHL,Reece,5.0,THE BEST ANDROID TABLET MONEY CAN BUY,25 April 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"okay so I bought this product mainly to use as a tablet which is great on this device. as a previous chrome OS user I love the flexibility this operating system can give a user, okay maybe I'm giving the device a lil too much praise, but honestly I don't care it's a really good device the only weak aspect to this device is tiny sounding speakers (but still perfectly useable). and it's second flaw is its single port if I had just one more usb c port an a headphone jack this would be a real killer device in my opinion an it's final short fall like me u may not realise it untill you purchase the device which is its a 32 bit arch which means some of the Linux applications I wanted to run on this device just aren't compatible due to this limiting factor especially since modern day smartphones are all on 64x or 86x arch types, as for gaming on this device it's a mixed bag in my opinion if Ur playing android app games some won't be supported like call of duty mobile even tho u can find videos of people playing it on this device. There are alot of apps you can use aswell such as stadia to game which is fine, aswell as some more intensive android apps that I can't even play on mobile like football manager 21 touch as oppose to the mobile version. I love that they keyboard an kickstand come included with the device which at times u may need aswell as usi stylus support and 8 years worth of updates on this device no other android tablet can boast that. my overall conclusion of this devices is a really solid device with support on chrome OS probably longer than many users will use the device, the corners cut to get device under £300 don't feel like corners because it has a beautiful display an great web cam for video calls or use the better 8mp rear camera to scan documents on the go, literally the only thing that may hamper your enjoyment is a lack of ports which is easily solved with a usb type c hub, but that's not really a complaint other then the dear old headphone jack (unless you got wireless headphones like me ) because most tablets only have one port but most tablets aren't a desktop os too.

However, with the keyboard and backstand, it is 1kg. Can you just have the tablet? Yes, but what's the point to have a light chromebook without keyboard. And also what about the case protection. Well, I do think the design sound very good, very good. But actually it has issues which you don't know until you bought it.

The tablet itself looks okay, light, neat. But the keyboard looks fragile, especially the connector. The magnetic may misplace a bit wrong sometimes. The ""hinge"" or the connector belt is so thin. It looks like it will break in not very long future.

Above is just about the design. It seems not slow, not exactly very fast. I am new to chromebook, need some more time before I can comment on other functions...",3

The base unit is medium size and was very clean with a few minor marks. Also it was well packaged with air-filled cushioning. There are plenty of USB ports (some USB2), HDMI port and a DisplayPort for connecting to a monitor.

It goes without saying that you need your own monitor, mouse and keyboard. I had expected a wifi dongle to be included as there is no wifi card inside the unit. I queried this with the seller and they sent one to me which arrived the next day.

That one came with a backlit keyboard, no fingerprint reader, and a standard battery. Beautiful device and i was sad to return it.
The replacement 24hrs later has no backlit keyboard but it does have the fingerprint thing and it has the large capacity battery. Powered up in about 2 seconds straight into windows 10 no problem. The casing and screen appears undamaged and clean, like new (almost). It has a core i5-7300, 1366 x 768 display, and the SSD and RAM are as advertised.

B082P7RKY6,Benjamin Haskell,2.0,"A good machine, but very tired and badly refurbished",24 August 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"On the whole I'm not totally upset with this purchase given the price, but it falls quite a long way short of what is advertised in a number of important ways.

The Good:
- It showed up quickly
- It works! The webcam, speakers, microphone, keyboard, touchpad, touchpoint, screen, all of it. Great!
- No bloatware, just a nice clean install of Windows 10 Professional
- Two batteries included (but we'll get on to the bad of that)
- Genuine Lenovo charger included
- Keyboard appears new and works perfectly, really nice to type on (I'm writing this review on it)

The Bad:
- The case wasn't clipped together properly near the right hand hinge when it was reassembled by the seller, and has a nasty gouge where they tried to force it. Some of the small clips in the area are also broken as a result
- The SSD included isn't original equipment, it's a no-name brand cheapo item so don't trust it not to die with no notice
- The screen isn't the 1920x1080 IPS one as listed in the product description, it's the much cheaper and worse 1366x768 TN panel
- The laptop doesn't include the 4G modem that the Q&A implies it might, it just has the SIM card tray and not the internal expansion card
- The charger included is broken at the laptop connector, but still works (just ugly)
- The touchpoint is a bit scabby but they're cheap and very easy to replace so
- The internal battery inside the laptop had failed and was bulging (which is really bad news for Lithium batteries and a potential fire hazard) - fortunately I noticed this when sorting out the bad clip job the seller did on the case. This has since been recycled and a replacement Lenovo battery ordered so it doesn't burn my house down
- Cosmetically the laptop appears in ""ok"" shape when looked at casually, but look slightly closer and you notice that both the touchpad and lid of the laptop are covered in a vinyl ""skin"" sticker which just covers up the wear marks (and numerous deep scratches in the case of the lid). This isn't a refurbishment, it's a cheap and nasty bodge job to make the laptop look less tired than it really is.

On the whole it's functional, and with one notable exception (the dangerous battery) the issues won't affect it's functionality for the majority of purchasers - but don't buy this thinking that ""Amazon Renewed"" means you're getting a nearly new laptop for a bargain price. What you're getting is a heavily used ex-corporate laptop which has had a tough life, cheaply and quickly tarted up to make it saleable (by someone who clearly isn't paying much attention to what they're doing). Buyer beware!

B0B4WP7SV9,Graeme,5.0,Cheap fully featured office machine.,25 August 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"Summary: great value laptop with excellent connectivity. Only for those who do not care about 3D graphics and do not want to use it on battery for extended periods.

- Network modules are widely supported by the linux kernel
- Full and nicely spaced out keyboard;
- Solid plastic construction reminiscent of cheaper vintage thinkPads, such as L and E series;

- Speakers have a narrow frequency response;
- No quick sign in features such as Windows Hello, finger print...;
- Fans audible and keyboard gets hot under intensive use and when charging;
- MacAfee antivirus bloatware pre-installed;
- Arrives with Windows 11 21H2 so Windows will serve you hours of updates initially;
- Bios is limited, such as no custom fan curve options only normal and silent modes;
- 3D gaming not an option on Intel UHD graphics;
- Webcam has no physical privacy shutter;
- No dedicated media buttons, have to use [FN] and function keys; and
- Small arrow keys with pgup pgdown too close by.

B0B4WP7SV9,Hoppie,4.0,Very capable laptop for the price,14 March 2025,the United Kingdom,False,"Had this laptop for 3 months now bought when on offer & reason was it has ethernet port (if wifi fails?), internal DVD/burner (use with my CD recorder) plus the 3 usb 3.0 ports along with 1 usb C which supports charging, micro card slot. It was to replace my ever slowing Lenovo ideapad 2017 8gb ram 1TB HDD this has similar architecture processer to my Lenovo but gives me 50% base line speed with overall 90% on boost, it came with 8gb ram (removable) so I bought an extra 16gb ram to install (yes two slots removable ram). Used 8gb ram to get all windows updates almost a week with updates daily (boot time 12 seconds) after the week fitted the extra 16gb ram (total 24gb now but can be upgraded to 32gb did read can go to 64gb???). so with 24gb ram still boots in 12 seconds just to see if ram increased boot time answer – no. Down side is as another has said annoying having to use FN to adjust volume/brightness etc (agree it is a backward step) and fan kicks in quite a lot sometimes. Battery doesn’t last anywhere near the specified 6hrs but put on charge when battery goes low 20/30 mins later almost 85% charged so seems to have fast charge to 85% then trickle charges after. Would I recommend yes (when on offer) Windows Pro 11, full keyboard HD screen no external DVD, ethernet accessories required, usb 3.0’s and plenty of ram for future expansion, no issues with setup bought all browser pages up as per my Lenovo, wifi 6 no issues, easy fit ram (1 screw plug & play) – so very happy with the product but 4 stars because of the FN key.",0

I decided to take a chance because the laptop I'd been using to work from home with failed over the past Easter weekend and I urgently needed to find a low-cost replacement. I edit and translate medical texts and couldn't afford to lose work. I reasoned that this would at least be a stop-gap solution.
Well, it arrived this morning, and straightaway I loved how slim, light and attractive it is. Set-up took about 30 minutes (and I'm certainly no computer nerd!) Start-up and re-boot are surprisingly fast for the modest 4GB RAM, and I have worked all day on the laptop with no problem opening several Microsoft 365 programs simultaneously, nor with surfing the net. It's much faster than my old laptop. Best of all, I received a notification from Microsoft asking me to run a PC health-check, at the end of which I was told I would be receiving the upgrade to Windows 11 shortly, and meantime offering me to get acquainted with the new features. All in all I am a very happy bunny and would encourage any ditherers like me to just buy it. I'm very glad I did!
-on edit- I have now received the Windows 11 upgrade which installed automatically and without glitch. It's great!!",21
B096XM6BCW,WarwickFay,4.0,Solid basic machine.,13 May 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"Its a cheap as cheap as ""granny laptop"". It does day to day stuff just fine but won't do anything overly taxing. 1080p screen is great looking, it runs smoothly, video playback is all good. For the money, if you're just looking for something to watch Netflix on, do the online shop, send emails, etc and surf the Internet then its absolutely fine. But don't don't expect it to run any powerful programs at all, its simply not built for that. The lack of a MicroSD slot (which comparible models tend to have) is a drawback because it means the only was to expand the memory is via USB flash or HDD drives but thats not the end of the world.
Overall, solid little machine if you just want a serviceable day to day laptop that you don't need for anything extravagant.",6

B0868V2JKH,Stewviking,5.0,"Superb, Like New, couldn’t be happier.",4 January 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"This is the first time I’ve ever considered buying a renewed or refurbished tech, I was not disappointed!

My laptop was renewed by “MicroDream Ltd” and let me say off the bat, they’ve done a bang-up job. The keyboard must be new, the casing is undistinguishable from a new Thinkpad, the mouse pad and buttons are all unblemished and clicking just right, as for the screen, it couldn’t be better if I had just peeled off the screen protector. Absolutely AAA standard. All the ports were dust free and the battery capacity is just as good as a brand-new Think Pad. All in all, I have never been more satisfied with a purchase than I have been with this renewed Laptop.

As for the Thinkad Itself, Lenovo make an absolutely premium laptop when it comes to robustness and quality, the I5, 5300U may seem a little dated in computer terms, but it delivers superfast processing power and coupled with 16gb of DD3 ram, it’s a power house of a laptop, my only woe is that does not have a TPM chip to enable upgrade to Windows 11, but since Windows 10 will give me everything I need for the foreseeable future this is not an issue for me.

The sound quality and volume of the laptop is the best I’ve had, no joke, it’s powerful and the image quality is amazing. Video streamed on it is perfect, no tearing or skipped frames, a real beautiful performance at 1080p

I am a techno junkie, and am always looking to buy laptops and computers, my whole family have laptops and when it comes to buying in the future, I will definitely be looking to buy renewed from these guys. It has been an absolute pleasure of an experience to get this level of service.

I definitely, highly recommend!

Amazon asking if I want a replacement or refund. Perfair to try resolve the issue first before we go down that road. Where was the quality control when they tested this item. Delete button not working. Number of the keys if you use them 3 other letters appear. I have reached out to the saler. We see have they handle issues. One would hope with all their positive reviews they help a customer out. Will update the outcome later in the week.

After trying to remove the hotkey lock many helpful email's to and from the seller. I had to return the laptop. Seller went above and beyond to help his customer. Very happy to recommend this seller.

B0F1YZMK2D,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 May 2025,the United States,False,"This laptop is really impressive out of the box. Impossibly light, especially for a 16"" machine. The 255H I found to be really fast, cool, and efficient. I barely hear this thing at all even when on 'best performance' mode.

One thing I wasn't sure about (and still am not) are LG's integrated AI features. I'm not totally sold on the dedicated AI button/key either (you might be accidentally hitting it a lot), but being able to run LLM features locally on the machine is kind of cool.

Build quality is excellent, comparable to ThinkPads and HP business units I've tried. Touchscreen was perfectly accurate out of the box and I keep forgetting it actually does have touch capability. OLED quality is also excellent and gets bright enough to work on my patio (As long as it's not peak daylight)

32 gigs of RAM is really appreciated - it's the new default of 8 gigs in my opinion. Had 0 dropped frames watching 4K videos online. For the specs of this model I would've hoped for Windows 11 Pro and not Home, but this unit is targeted more towards a home user.

Perhaps the biggest downfall to this unit is that sticker price - ouch. Using this unit though, I get the feeling of 'you get what you pay for' considering the MSRP. It's a rock solid laptop with specs that are built to last. Very impressed overall.

seperation is very good . The speakers are on the front edge facing you The left and right soulder buttons i find to be a bit flimsy.

B0CLGJ18WB,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,24 January 2024,the United States,False,"This is a neat little device featuring the Intel N100 processor. I'm an aficionado of tiny laptops and devices for the times you need something more than a smartphone, but a full laptop is overkill. I liked nearly everything about this smol computer, a very versatile and portable design with a quality build and a nice little screen. The ""mouse"" sensor works okay and isn't my favorite thing, but it's understandable given the size of the device. As other reviews have noted, the device is thicker than expected. I also found the hinge/swivel mechanism the screen is mounted on is a little unwieldy and too large for such a small device. These weren't deal killers for me. Windows 11 runs well -- I did a clean install and was able to activate Windows without issue. The N100 is powerful and makes this a much more practical device than ultraportable PCs of the past, especially when hooked up to an external monitor. Ultimately, the deal killer for me is the keyboard layout, which is nonstandard and frustrates any efforts to touch type, slow type, or most other typing on this thing, rendering it nearly useless for me -- I'd rather use a tablet than this, and my tablets have a larger screen even if they don't have a keyboard.

I ended up buying and keeping a 7-inch mini laptop elsewhere (known as the Topton L4 or by a dozen other names) with a lower power Celeron processor, because the keyboard design on the 7-inch mini is FAR better and makes that much more usable for most folks for any purpose.

Sims 4 keeps crashing no matter what I do. Sometimes my lockscreen picture would be met with no picture and a black screen, and I would have to restart to get it back. It just feels buggy.

update. 4/13/2025

I had to send it in to be repaired back in December 2024. It works fine now. The whole motherboard had to be replaced along with the hard drive and fan. Good thing this came with a warranty because all these issues happened way after the return date. For a brand new system this was insane. Do not get this product.

Performs better than my desktop (3070ti, ryzen 7 3700x). Haven't seen any info on whether or not it has an additional m.2 slot, so I'd like to know that before cracking it open (did so on my 2022 version). Tampering with Armorycrate and power saving settings allows me to get a good 6+ hours of battery life, totally serviceable for school use though I keep the power cord and a battery bank close at hand anyway. Somewhat annoyed by the lack of USB A connectors, there's only 2. There are 2 USB C connectors which is nice, but I don't have anything to leverage those at the moment. I preferred having the ports on the back rather than the sides as they now interfere with the workspace, but understand the sacrifice for cooling.

B0BX6M5CPX,Loose Screws,4.0,"Great laptop for my needs, few peeves though",10 December 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"I had to buy a new windows laptop to run some programs that won't work with Mac. I only needed something decently priced with fair specs, and this has been a great choice.

Setup was easy (although it's been a while since I used Windows, there's a lot more steps to set up with now that slightly irritated me, but hey that's Windows). It didn't take the full 3 hours to fully charge the battery like it suggested in the manual, but I still left it plugged in. Life on the battery is decent, can't complain. I don't need a long life battery for hours and hours, so this suits my needs.

As someone else mentioned, the screen is difficult to see from certain angles. For me, where it is on my desk to control my desktop laser machine, I had to buy a riser to sit it on and even then, I have to bend down to be eye level to see the screen clearly. I had to change the cursor color because it's hard to see unless you are directly in eyeline of the screen (and with goggles on it's even harder) - a small and fixable issue but I still wanted to mention it.

I downloaded Steam (as someone who has an imac, it was a perk to be able to finally have a choice of all the games on there) and tried to set up my spare PS4 controller, however it just doesn't seem to want to work right. Whether that's an issue with this windows, or another issue entirely I don't know, but that's disappointing as I'm still trying to figure it out, and no amount of calibrating seems to work. So I haven't even been able to assess the game quality on this new laptop yet. I guess I'll just use the keyboard.

But, bth, I didn't buy it for gaming, and it works well for its intended use. I got it in the Black Friday sales so the price was great.

B0CNY2W1CP,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,2 February 2014,the United States,False,"Very satisfied with this monitor: PIP was essential!

I bought mine in late September of 2011; I have never used the internal speakers, so I cannot comment on them. I am writing this now, because after 2 ¼ years of satisfaction with this monitor, I have just ordered a new PC, and have been reading the reviews to prepare myself for what may come, when I connect it to this.

My current PC is very old, and the drivers for its video adapter (an ALL-IN-WONDER 9600) are out of date, as are those for the motherboard. I have both VGA and HDMI ports connected; VGA to my PC and HDMI to a COMCAST / CISCO DVR. The ALL-IN-WONDER video adapter has software that makes connecting monitors almost foolproof, & it automatically detects the appropriate resolution settings.

The monitor's information screen indicates these parameters when those sources are selected:

VGA 1920X1080 67KHZ 60 HZ
HDMI: 1080i

I initially intended to connect the new PC via the DISPLAY PORT while keeping the old one on the VGA until I had copied all the files onto the new one's hard drive, but since then, see no need for that. Thus, I will connect it via VGA port. I will edit this review after the new PC is connected.

As I recall, when I first connected this to my PC, which at the time was set to 16xx by whatever, when I set it to its native resolution, there was a dead pixel. I was very disappointed, & returned the screen resolution to the lower setting, in preparation for reconnecting the old monitor. I shut down the system and was about to disconnect the cable, but for some reason, turned the PC on, again, & again selected the native resolution of 1920 x 1080. I found no dead pixels! I cannot account for why it had a dead pixel the first time, though having been an electronic technician for 10 years, I had seen some strange things. I knew where that dead pixel had been, & could not find it the 2nd time. I have been completely satisfied with this monitor ever since.

There are only 2 things I truly dislike: when the PIP is on, the audio source selector is grayed out. I had to run the RF out from the DVR through my VCR and out though its red & white phono jacks into a phono to miniature phone jack adapter & into the rear speakers of my 4 channel amplified speaker system.

The 2nd thing: when the screensaver turns the monitor off, it does not merely switch the screen off, but the audio also.

I have seen a few reviews that noted it has a tendency to wobble; I also found this true, but it is a minor annoyance.

Other reviews noted that the screen is VERY bright; I agree, but its default setting is:

BRIGHTNESS: 100%
CONTRAST: 87%

thus, it is set for very bright ambient light.

It also has COLOR TEMPERATURE settings; I selected COOL, set the brightness to 6% and the contrast between 43 and 50%, depending on what old movies I may be watching. If they are really faded, a higher contrast is needed, but this is rarely the case. Currently, it is 50%; I rarely need to chance these settings, though, because the contrast ratio is so very high. Watching old movies on my old GATEWAY monitor was not much fun, because the screen simply could not produce dark enough shades with its 1000:1 contrast ratio; yet, this ASUS monitor has a 10,000,000:1 contrast ratio, and I have yet to find a program difficult to see on this screen. As I write this, I have 2 CFL bulbs turned on; 1 is a 3-way equivalent 70, 100, 150 watt; it is bounced off the ceiling, & is usually the only one I use when watching movies, which I do from a distance of about 8 or 9 feet away from the screen. For shows with a lot of dark scenes, I sometimes switch the 3-way down to the 70 watt setting. The other is a 200 watt equivalent; both are aimed at the ceiling, and this indirect light is all I need. My room is not particularly bright, despite the bright bulbs, because they are aimed at the ceiling. When I used the 0% brightness, I used only the 3 way bulb, but for watching cable movies, sometimes the darker scenes were too dark. As I dislike constantly changing the settings, I finally settled on the 6% brightness & 50% contrast.

One reviewer complained that this monitor would not work at its native resolution when connected via VGA. I added a comment to that review, but will here say that the monitor has timing requirements at the various pixel resolutions / color depths; there is only 1 for the VGA input at 1920 x 1080; I assume this is an industry standard. The user's manual can be downloaded from ASUS' website's Customer Service page. Amazon deleted the link, but it can be found easily by searching the web for Asus + ve278q. The manual has been updated since I downloaded it the 1st time. It is in the .rar format.

It is not included in the package, though. It should be easy to compare one's video adapter's timing charts to the timing charts for this monitor, to ensure compliance between them. Though I am sure that the timing at 1920x1080 is a VGA standard.

HDMI: There are 4 compatible timing settings for the HDMI input at 1920x1080. When I switch to HDMI, I see a large message that clears away after a second stating that the monitor is not compatible with HDMI or some such thing, but it always clears away before I can even begin to read it. I am not sure if it comes from the DVR or the monitor, though I am leaning toward the former.

Viewing angles: I have no complaints here, as the screen is viewable from very wide horizontal angles; vertical are not so wide, but I can hardly see myself standing over it looking down.

IMAGE CLARITY: I am very impressed; I was watching MONSTER BUG WARS a year ago, & using the DVR remote used the zoom feature. I was astonished at the detail; which speaks highly of both the monitor & the DVR, not to mention the camera work. The color seems very accurate, though I have nothing against which to compare it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT (03/29/2014):

I have recently bought a new PC that has a displayport video output. I connected it with this cable (IM1-NZ7268 Accell B142C007B 656 DisplayPort to DisplayPort Cable, about $17). As I had read another person's review that found fault with the use of the DISPLAYPORT, I was a bit hesitant to use that connection. Yet, I found no such occurrence. Another reviewer mentioned something about a VESA COMPLIANT cable (which this is) not having the problem.

My Dell PC has a RADEON HD 8490 graphics card.

Cable: Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Accell-UltraAV-B142C-007B-2-DisplayPort-Locking/dp/B00CD1FB3A/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394161130&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=IM1-NZ7268+Accell+B142C007B+656+DisplayPort+to+DisplayPort+Cable

I am very satisfied with the performance of the monitor using DisplayPort; when streaming audio, if I turn off the monitor, the PC switches to its internal speaker. Obviously the monitor itself has nothing to do with this, and it may be a feature unique to Dell PCs, but I thought I would mention it, because I had earlier noted that because the monitor acts as a distribution hub for the audio (both HDMI & line-in) when it shuts off, the audio shuts off with it.
Above I had noted that the monitor does not allow selection of audio sources while in VGA; I thought it should allow selection of HDMI when using that as the source for the Picture in picture. There is no difference here while using displayport & HDMI in the PIP, though [Line-in] is available when displayport is used (as the main source) whether or not the PIP is on.
Note that when using HDMI, line-in is also available as the audio source.
GENERAL:
Other reviewers note that there is an annoying bleed of light at the very edges of the screen. This is only noticeable when the screen is very dark near the edges. My old Gateway monitor also had this effect. Anyway, I have not much noticed it actually affecting the pictures being viewed, though it is there. It does seem more or less noticeable as I alter the height at which I view the screen. lowering my chair a bit or leaning back makes the bleed at the bottom edge less visible.
In closing, you might want to start by reading the one-star reviews, as you may find something relevant to your situation. Spending $250+ may make taking the time well worth it.

B0CNY2W1CP,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,18 September 2011,the United States,False,"Pros: This is an excellent display for the price, very crisp and bright. Not a lot of graffiti on the bezel either, nice and simple. Not a single dead pixel to be found. Great connection options, every type you need. The built in speakers are decent, not great but certainly better than others I have heard and usable for sure. The power light is only an indicator of the state of the device, not a spot light/strobe light, hardly even notice it is there. Physical buttons, this may be a con if you are more into the newer touch type but I prefer the mechanical style myself. They run across the bottom of the screen facing down, out of the way and easy to use without drawing unnecessary attention.

Cons: I have noticed a bit of ghosting on fast moving objects. It isn't a lot, but you can definitely see it. I have adjusted the trace free setting from off up to max in an attempt to find the sweet spot. I have not been able to eliminate the effect yet.

Other Thoughts: You really can't go wrong with this monitor in this price range. The colors are vibrant and bright, whites are very pure while blacks remain invisible. I didn't have to do any adjustments out of the box, the thing looked great right away. It was at my door within a few days of ordering, always a pleasure doing business with you guys, thanks for the awesome LED monitor Amazon.

La puissance est également remarquable, surtout en mode 10W (""niveau 1""), ce qui permet de faire tourner de nombreux jeux en mode medium tout en optimisant l'autonomie.

Les touches répondent très bien, sans aucun souci à signaler. De plus, Windows 11 fonctionne parfaitement et offre de nombreuses possibilités de paramétrage pour les jeux. J'ai particulièrement apprécié la possibilité d'écrire des scripts pour désactiver l'écran tactile lors du lancement de jeux Lego, résolvant ainsi un problème commun à de nombreux ordinateurs gamers dotés d'un écran tactile. L'installation de mods pour les jeux est également possible, ce qui enrichit l'expérience.

En ce qui concerne la bibliothèque de jeux, c'est un véritable régal. On a accès à tous les jeux existants, que ce soit sur Steam, Xbox ou d'autres consoles via l'émulation. La communauté de la Rog Ally sur Discord ou Reddit est très active et apporte une aide précieuse pour résoudre les problèmes éventuels.
En revanche documentez vous avant de l'acheter, il existe des problèmes sur la console non négligeable, elle n'est pas parfaite certes, mais l'équipe d'Asus travail sur la résolution des problèmes.

Si vous souhaitez retrouver vos jeux PC sur une console portable, je vous recommande vivement d'opter pour celle-ci. Certes, le prix est un peu élevé, d'autant plus si vous envisagez de changer le SSD. Pour ma part, je pense que cette console en vaut largement la peine. Jouer partout, où vous voulez quand vous voulez.

B0C14HZ14D,Arctic Rose,3.0,Inaccurate product specification,4 July 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"Laptop was advertised as IDEAPAD 7505, 500GB hard disk size with 20GB RAM. However, when I registered the product for warranty with Lenovo, the serial number revealed that this was in fact an IdeaPad 317IAU7 laptop, with 4GB of RAM and 128GB hard drive.
Please, please make sure that you advertise the actual model with the correct spec as I would never have bought it otherwise as I was looking for a higher spec which I thought I was getting.
It was a real hassle returning the product and I spent days communicating with Amazon in order to return (which I had to organise and pay for a courier, etc. which was completely unacceptable as this was Amazon/seller fault. I did get my money back including the postage in the end but this was after 2 weeks of hassle. However I must add that Amazon was very helpful albeit inefficient at times and giving contradictory information but I got there in the end.
I'm giving this a 3 star rating as the product may still be okay (for what it is) and it was working when I set it up initially.",39

B0BMW3P87R,Mrs M.,5.0,"Great spec, great laptop",7 April 2025,the United Kingdom,False,"I bought this at £499, in a few days the price has increased by £80! ( tariff knock on maybe). Even so this is an excellent spec for the price, super sharp oled screen, i5 processor, 16gb ram, 1tb ssd drive. I knew it was a bargain when I saw it for a local committee i am part of, and now kicking myself I didn’t buy one for myself as well. Out of the box it needed the usual time wasting windows updates so spent about an hour doing that, then discovered that the trackpad was not working. Did some online research and found it needed an Asus firmware update which fixed the problem. I still give it 5 stars because this was a steal at the price and out of the box updates are a necessity. The oled screen is just beautiful, its fast and im sure for the general day to day use it will receive it will be perfect. Not bought as a gaming machine so not sure of the graphics capabilities.",6
B0BMW3P87R,Lynn Budden,5.0,Excellent value for money,23 January 2025,the United Kingdom,False,"This was to replace a laptop I bought second hand several years ago but have spent multiple times a day cursing as it was sooooo slow. I don’t game but I do use a lot of fairly sizeable spreadsheets to organise my life. It was painful! This ASUS is so fast I rarely have time to blink. The keyboard and mouse are good too but I use separate ones for 99% of the time. This item was the spec I didn’t think I could afford.

I would say that some may find the screen a bit small but this is set up on a desk and is the same screen size as the previous one which was ideal for me. It looks a lot smaller as the ‘frame’ is much narrower and it’s so thin. Weighs very little.

Windows 11 takes a bit of getting used to but then so did the system on the previous one. The set up was easy but a friend did help copying all my ‘stuff’ over. Like moving home it’s time to clear the attic out. Painful to see how much rubbish and duplication I have on there.

This is WiFi only and we set the printer option to WiFi which means a lot less cabling. There seems to be a lot more ports too so I can probably get rid of of the multi socket thing I’ve got for the separate keyboard and mouse. Hopefully this will outlast me!

The colours are amazing so this may become my device of choice for tv catch up and not my mini iPad or my aging tv.

B0BMW3P87R,M Z,4.0,"Powerful but otherwise very ""budget""",7 December 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"This is for the X1504ZA model which is i5 12th gen and 16gb ram.

I snatched this for under 400 as a warehouse deal - at this price this laptop can be really great value because it's so hard to find many affordable options with 16gb ram. However, you need to be aware there's no magic pricing here - significant corners were cut which may or not matter to you.

1. Screen: the specs say ""IPS-level"" but I wonder if this is actually a glorified TN panel? The viewing angles are incredibly poor, using this laptop on the couch is very complicated since you have to be facing the screen at a perfect angle. The colours are mediocre as with most budget laptops but OK but surfing the web etc. The brightness is quite low, lower than the MSI Modern 15 and an HP 14s-dq2502na, probably very difficult to use on a sunny day (but those don't come all that often eh?)

2. Battery life: appalling. You can get 4.5hs of light use if you're lucky. (I profiled it extensively) This was the same as the 1 year old HP 14, and 1-1.5 hours less than the MSI Modern 15 with Ryzen 7730U with a marginally smaller battery (39Wh vs 41Wh). The vivobook draws on average on idle 1.5W more than the MSI Modern which is almost to be expected as the i5 can't beat the ryzen in power consumption. This, paired with a small battery and probably low quality components that are very power inefficient (and a larger screen) means you just can't get much battery life. People claiming it's great are likely coming from ancient dusty laptops that can barely hold a charge.

3. Ports: so outdated. The USB-C port does not support charging nor video out. The poor battery life could be compensated by easy charging via USB-C but no, you have to carry the (albeit small) proprietary barrel charger everywhere which is highly impractical if you move around the house or generally use this on your lap... Also because of this, you can only ever support 1 external monitor so OK but not ideal for say, working.

If you don't care about any of the above then the laptop is actually very good value depending on the price you get it for. The build is really good for the price, I really enjoyed the keyboard (minus the unusual bottom row of the numpad). The touchpad was very good even if the mouse did skip a few times. The bezels are small and the whole unit feels solid for a plastic build and actually looks sleek if you don't look too hard at it. As a last negative, I'm personally not a fan of the 16:9 aspect ratio, the 15.6"" screen seems too wide and short - I find the newer 16:10 to be far more practical and enjoyable but you can't have it all at a budget level, just consider this as well. Lastly, as you'd expect the performance with the recent 12th gen i5 and 16gb of ram (and a decent NVMe SSD) is actually excellent for a budget laptop, super speedy.

B0BMW3P87R,RSGliori(Alias23),5.0,Good value and easily upgraded,2 March 2025,the United Kingdom,False,"As one would expect from Asus this is a capable, well designed machine. An aluminium cased option would be even better and worth paying more for, my previous Asus is aluminium cased and has stood the test of time, the only reason I have upgraded at all is that recent software updates have rendered it obsolete for the purposes I require it for.
Upgrading the RAM is simple, it will support 40gb easily enough after a straightforward BIOS update, I swapped the 8gb stick for a 32gb by Crucial (make sure to get the correct spec, it's important) and it improved its performance dramatically. It will also be receiving a storage capacity upgrade once I work out the best option, the 500gb provided is adequate for most users I would imagine but I would be happier with a minimum of 1tb onboard storage, like most modern laptops there aren't many ports available so external drives aren't ideal (I use it for live music performance and DJing which requires wired connections to controllers and professional sound card modules).",12

B01LZE0396,Alex,4.0,Good for the price,21 January 2017,the United Kingdom,False,"This was an impulse purchase, but for the price it's more than you could expect. The sound impresses more than the screen - although the screen is OK, the sound is much better than expected. Performance is OK, there can be slowdown scrolling on some web pages.

Battery life on first charge seems to be meeting expectations, it might reach the claimed 12 hours,

I'm not expecting this to be a laptop replacement or even an android tablet replacement, it's somewhere in between when surfing on the sofa.

Click and drag requires a physical click then drag rather than a touch click and drag that's been the norm for Windows for a while - I couldn't get Google Maps to scroll at first.

B09JZFZJCJ,Steve,5.0,What's not to like,30 August 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"I didn't order this laptop until I carried out hours of research. There will always be something that someone dislikes about any laptop, but we all have our own preferences and that's not a bad thing.
The touch pad is sensitive and you need to get used to it and as to where you click it for different uses. But like anything, it takes a little time, but you will soon get to master it. Otherwise it's fine.
I've seen one video on YouTube where someone remarked on it only being available in grey (to each his/her own, I like it though). However, it is manufactured in aluminium and looks and feels great. It's lighter than most laptops I've used. It helps that it doesn't have a heavy removable battery clipped to it's 'undercarriage'.
The Intel core i7 12th generation processor is fast, really fast.
Storage is in the form of a 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD and can be updated. There is an additional slot to add another M.2 NAMe SSD (I've just ordered another 1TB today).
There is 16GB of RAM fitted and is not upgradeable, but I really don't have a problem with that. 16GB of RAM is more than enough for most uses (with a few exceptions like hard core gamers and such like).
What I really like is the amount and choice of USB slots etc (see info on Amazon).
The HD screen is a nice touch. The quality is excellent when watching a film or looking at hi-res photos. The sound is good enough through its built in speakers, but it it isn't that loud, good enough for listening to music and films. Connect some headphones and you won't be disapointed!
Like most laptops these days, it doesn't come with a CD / DVD player, which allows more space for Acer to incorporate extras, like an excellent cooling system (that is extremely quite and efficient). You can get external plug and play CD/DVD player/burners for around £20 or so.
If you want to know more to to Acer website, downloads. Enter model no and download user manual for free.
In short: Excellent fast performing, thin, light and yet a very robust laptop. 16inch screen makes a difference ( though I have been using an HP 17inch up until recently).

Brief note: Word within the computing industry is that all laptop manufacturers will stop making 15 and 17 inch laptops. Laptops will come with industry standard 16 and 18 inch screens. As to when this will happen is anyone's guess, but as the Acer 16 inch was released in 2022 then I expect it will happen sooner rather then later.

Why not 5*? If I could give 4.5 I would. As I said, easy to use, just what i needed plenty of storage. Downsides only one USB port. Cant have mouse and second screen at same time unless I use my extra USB port thing, which isn't a huge deal but annoying. For my set up battery cable on wrong side, again not huge issue, bit cable is bent back which in long term may cause damage. USB is on right side as left handed.
Real issue which is not the laptop, is windows 11 is installed which if you like it is great you dont have to purchase it separately. But I hate it, particularly new outlook. So I have installed last version of windows, but laptop keeps trying to update it.

It's worth the money and I'll definitely will recommend it.

As for the screen touch I have no comments about that due to that I'm still getting use to the laptop and adjusting to know the programing and so on.
But I'm very happy about this laptop big time I think I might be getting another one for back up but not sure as yet but let me advise you if you looking for a great laptop than this is the one for you

B09XBRZFGX,MrsGregs,5.0,Absolutely love this! But get a mouse!,19 September 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"I thought it wasn't going to be up to much when I saw the price of it. But I thought I would give it a try knowing I could return it with the Amazon guarantee.
I was disappointed at first with it due to only using my finger on the pad. It wasn't very responsive, probably due to the fact that I have very long nails.
I was ready to pack it up and return after one day.
I decided to give it a try with the mouse from my other pc.
And WOW!! What a difference it made.
There is a part of the keyboard that is blank that I use for the mouse and it's enough. Im guessing this is why the space was left.
The keyboard is very easy to use and the numbers block on the right hand side is handy.
This laptop does not run off Windows it runs off Linux but behaves exactly like a laptop. I was confused by the lack of icons on the screen. Apparently they don't sit there, they sit in the 'tray' below the screen or the side or the top. Wherever you want to put it. At first I didn't like it but now I've got used to it I really do. And it leaves the screen clear.
This system runs on apps, just like my phone.. or it can still run off of websites too.
It connects to your phone and shows up any WhatsApp messages or texts etc, which I find very handy to have.
The sound quality is quite good. Doesn't sound tinny, like a lot of them do.
Superfast boot up. Seconds. Impressive.
It has a micro memory slot which is very handy indeed. I put a 512gb in there and it read it, no problem

Battery life is excellent.
It's quite heavy and very sturdy.
Couple of downsides, which are not too bothersome.
Only 2 usb slots.
No HDMI slot either, which would have been nice.
All in all the positives out weigh the negatives.
Get one! But get a mouse!!

B09XBRZFGX,FinishedWithReviews,5.0,Very Good for browsing,9 November 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"Good for the price (so far) and i'm very pleased with all the functions. No right click though? Press alt and double tap the pad.....loads super quick, responds well, resolution is good. Happy",2
B09XBRZFGX,Amazon Customer,5.0,Should have done this years ago (and I'm a tech savvy computer geek).,10 September 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"I'd never owned a Chromebook before and at this price I thought there wasn't much to lose so I took the plunge. In all honesty I'm absolutely blown away and amazed. I totally now understand why Chrome OS has recently overtook Apple as the second most used operating system.

Boots up in about 6 seconds and is online immediately. Everything is fast including Youtube. It's sort of comparable in speed to an I7 quad core Windows machine and even then it does some things quicker still. It doesn't have to load and deal with all the legacy APIs that Windows has to nor does it need any sub-systems. It's an optimised and extremely lean operating system. So even though it's only a Celeron N4500 with 4GB of ram it absolutely flies. You also don't have to worry about updates or viruses and when it does update its seamless and unobtrusive. Everything is nice and super simple. Once you get it you really do appreciate how much of a slow burden Windows was on your computer. Other nice touches are total integration with your Android phone. If your phone is nearby you'll see your Whatsapp messages come on the laptop screen and if anyone sends you a picture on Whatsapp you'll see that too and you can download it to the laptop immediately.

The disadvantage of course is that it can't run Windows software. But I'd say that that is probably irrelevant for about 9 out of 10 people these days as most users are doing everything online now and this trend is accelerating at a rapid pace. Ultimately everything will be internet and cloud based in the end anyway. Also remember that if a computer is used for work purposes then this will usually be provided by the employer. But if you are reliant on specialist Windows applications such as music making software or CAD software then this machine might not be suitable (but even that is changing rapidly too due to online tools).

Google Docs is excellent and for me at least it has totally dispelled the need for Microsoft Office and it's also a lot better than Microsoft's Office 365 online version. With Chrome OS being online based it has forced me to look for online browser versions of the things that I use a computer for. And everything is there, even Solitaire!

The machine itself is a dream come true. Most importantly for me (yes most importantly), it is a very stylish and elegant design and itches all cravings for a Macbook Pro with flying colours. It's very well built and the chassis has military grade certification and is tested. There is a small amount of keyboard flex but I think this is irrelevant at this price point and it doesn't move when typing. The computer is also nice and up to date and has USB C charging from both the left and right side of the computer. Nice touch.

So it's a complete winner and a game changer for me and I can't see myself ever buying a Windows based laptop again. As mentioned in the title I am a computer geek. I've used them all right from the ZX Spectrum days and I'll guarantee you that you won't regret this. The Chromebook is a winner.

B097NBWRQK,Billy Hunt,1.0,I had to send it back because technically it negated the Amazon Renewed warranty,21 February 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"Unfortunately, when I checked the machine it was not the same specification as the machine advertised (the CPU was different) and whilst it made little material difference to performance (and the machine came up without problem), it negated the 'Amazon Renewed' 12 month warranty guarantee. After all what would most people suspect if a machine was returned with a lesser cheaper CPU chip than the one it was supposed to have been sold with? As the warranty clearly attracted a cost overhead I sent it back as I would have been paying for a warranty that I could not use. The supplier then dutifully refunded my payment and decently apologised. So no complaints there.

However, it was clear that the supplier was oblivious to the details of the 'Amazon Renewed' warranty to the point where I began to think it was nothing more than an advertising stunt. I suggest in future Amazon makes sure that its sub-contractors are fully aware of the deals it is offering on their behalf and ensures what they supply fully fulfils the terms of that offer.

Suffice to say I have now picked up a Dell Optiplex 9020 MT with the 4790 Processor but less storage from elsewhere for a considerably cheaper price albeit without any significant warranty and am very happy with the machine I ended up with. Shame Amazon couldn't organise their offer properly.

B0CQ3RRS23,Mr Pickle Johnson,5.0,"**IMPRESSED** THINKING UNPACKED BELOW (will HELP YOU in the Laptop maze of dither, doubt & delay)",20 January 2025,the United Kingdom,False,"ABOUT THE SELLER
Sent within hours of ordering via recorded / signed for Royal Mail delivery. Very carefully and safely packaged.

ABOUT THE PRODUCT
I'm not part of the cult of Apple and firmly in the Windows, but not Chromebook camp. Increasingly I am a bit of a Samsung whore and there are advantages to that as you benefit from what I understand is called the ""Samsung ecosystem"" with their phones, TVs, earphones etc and actually I have had a flurry of new purchases lately when unusually for me everything has just worked first time and then even connected with other stuff as they say it should.

First impressions are really very positive especially about the quality, thinness and appearance of the laptop. The screen and particularly audio are really very good. This is my first Samsung laptop after I fell out with HP (never buy an HP printer unless you want to have a stroke or print something from Mars which it won't). I had always found Samsung laptops a bit cheap looking with a horrible wobble after you touched the screen / someone walked by / an ant breathed in New Zealand (even when facing South) BUT this one is much sturdier.

Once I had taken several months to get my head around the really confusing range of Samsung Book Numbers / Models / Subtypes (they do that with every other product too) this one had to be the one to go for as I really find the 16"" ones too big and ugly plus I did prefer to stay with a decent, familiar and established processor like the i7 ultra from Intel. There doesn't seem to be an 8 and the 9 is way too expensive and generally too unnecessary as things stand. The Snapdragon processors may be ok in due course but from what I gathered they do have some teething / compatibility problems and their longer-term performance in a laptop just isn't known. I think you will find too that no-one laptop ticks your own boxes and that you have to weigh everything up so the compromise with this one is the lack of an S pen plus not the 360 screen though I've had both on previous laptops and not really used either...we all have a bit of FOMO though.

BUT LASTLY....THE BOTTOM LINE
The price from this seller couldn't be beaten and all the marginal benefits like loyalty points aren't going to be worth the over £300 saving I made here. I've ended up getting a much higher spec and more modern device for less than my old crappy HP thing that only lasted a couple of years.

P.S. I tend to only review things in detail where I am confident it's a great deal or a terrible one...you decide!

B0CQ3RRS23,Anonyme,2.0,Sans titre,5 March 2025,the United States,False,"TLDR: I really wanted to like this laptop. Read a bunch of bad reviews and took a chance anyway thinking some people just got a bad batch of products. I was wrong. The bad reviews are accurate.

From top to bottom. Build quality is good. Opening the box it looked awesome. The screen is really good. 120hz refresh rate is awesome. It gets pretty bright and the colors look amazing. Keyboard is meh as there’s not a lot of key travel but it does have a backlight which I find kinda dim but it works. Track pad is okay, not too picky on that myself. The HMDI 2.1 is actually 2.1 and not 2.0 with a bunch of fake marketing to try and pass it off as true 2.1. It let me run games at 4k120hz on my TV using my GeForce now ultimate subscription.

The stuff that i really didn’t like was the CPU, IGPU, overall performance and battery life. The ultra core 7 155h would thermal throttle all day long. Even on light to medium loads. And it would do it erratically. It would go from an higher clock at first, thermal throttle to like 0.5Ghz then back up and down again. Really made for a bad experience using the laptop. Internet tabs and other light apps would constantly stutter and rubber band. Same thing for the GPU. It would run some light games like WOW good at first. With in 5 mins it would thermal throttle down really bad and performance would tank. The battery would only last me 4-5 hours max on light usage. Anything heavier like installing programs and watching videos is get 2-3 hours max, maybe less. And this is after I did some cpu clock tweaking and set max performance to 75%.

The core ultra 7 155h just didn’t fit well in a thin and light laptop like this. Just not enough cooling and efficiency.

B00G4E60UA,Mr. C Bell,5.0,"Great little computer, pity about the Windows operating system!",1 November 2014,the United Kingdom,False,"This is a great little machine that will do everything that a full-featured traditional laptop will do, and then will also work as a touch-screen tablet as well - so you get the best of both worlds in one neat package.

Good points:

- It is a good size: small enough to be easily portable, but large enough to be readable.

- The keyboard is just large enough for those (like me) with thick stubby fingers to use it.

- The screen is perfectly adequate both in terms of resolution and viewing angle.

- It is running an Intel chip with x86 architecture, or in plain English it is a conventional PC that will run any programme that a desktop PC will run. That means you can use it just like an ordinary PC if you want.

- It is dead easy to disconnect the keyboard and have just a plain tablet, and just as easy to reconnect it again.

- The battery does seem to last all day, at least when used the way we use it.

Bad points:

- Only one full-sized USB port, and that is on the keyboard unit. However there is a micro USB on the screen unit.

- The microphone makes the user sound as if he is talking underwater unless he speaks directly into it.

... otherwise I can't fault the machine, and I love it. Which brings me to that operating system, Windows 8.

If you know all about W8 then skip the next two paragraphs, otherwise read on.

Windows 8 has a ""tablet"" touch screen mode, referred to as ""metro"", and also the traditional Windows desktop just like previous versions of Windows. You can swap between the two, and because this machine has a keyboard and touch pad it is perfectly feasible to use the traditional desktop mode, and this is just as well because otherwise you would be stranded in the Windows 8 metro ecosystem. Also if you want to do anything with this machine it forces you to sign up for a microsoft account, and thereafter that account is your login id - effectively trying to lock the machine to being ""Microsoft only"".

Don't get me wrong, Microsoft services work and metro is easy to use once you've learned its little ways, the problem is that Microsoft have obviously glanced enviously at Apple and have tried to emulate the way that Apple lock users into only being to download ""apps"" from the Apple store. W8 comes pre-configured with ""all Microsoft"" apps: Skype, Bing search, MS news, MS games, XBox emulation, and so on ... which is absolutely wonderful if you think MS products are the best thing since sliced bread, but not so great if you don't. For example the W8 mail app tries to steer you towards using MS email, but grudgingly lets you use your existing 3rd party ISP's email account if you *really* want to ... except that it doesn't support the planet earth's most common ""pop3"" email protocol. If you think that is an arcane problem try configuring your existing email to use it! Another problem is that MS apps are ""black boxes"" that either work ... or don't. And if they don't work (neither Skype nor Mail metro apps worked for us) there is no equivalent of the Apple store where an uber-cool person in a black polo-neck jumper will sort you out.

Fortunately because it has a keyboard and a useable, traditional desktop interface you can download 3rd party software such as FIrefox (browser), the desktop version of Skype (which did work, don't ask me why...), Thunderbird for email, and so on. You can also load software you have previously run on your existing PC. So if you are even a mildly savvy user you have a get-out from the attempts by Microsoft to lock you into their software ecosystem - in fact you have the best of both worlds: apps where they work for you, and traditional software where they don't.

Therefore if you are looking for a tablet that is cheap, does everything that a laptop will do, and yet also works in touch-screen tablet mode I think this is a great machine. However if you just want a tablet and don't really think you need the keyboard then I recommend that you go for an Android machine.

I found the keyboard excellent – it is as good as it can be this size. Notice that it is the keyboard that has determined the size of the device not the screen. The weight is slightly more than I thought it would be and maybe slightly heavier than some alternative devices because of the clip that docks the computer to the keyboard. The clip works extremely well and I would not like it to be lighter and therefore of a more fragile construction. If you want a keyboard dock as well as tablet then it needs to be as solid as this. Asus’s experience with several versions of Transformer has proved that their arrangement works. Sound quality is extraordinary for the size of the speakers. Glossy finish on the back of screen is less than ideal but you will end up having to wipe the front of the touch screen in any event. A matt finish would have been better.
The Bay Trail Intel processor is a real advance on power/performance/cost ratio – previously netbooks were under powered - not any longer. If you have an Asus Nexus 7 then you will understand the power charger and the on/off switch. Power-up is hold in for 4-5 seconds to prevent accidental switch-on. To force a hard power-down hold in for 10-12 seconds in the event you have to do this.
Size and portability is great with the advantage of being able to use as 10 inch tablet for video viewing. Most of the time this Transformer is used docked with a Cable Matters 4-Port SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Portable Compact Hub £11 from Amazon providing four slots to fit a keyboard, mouse and back-up storage. Only other extra is a Micro HDMI TO VGA with Audio Cable Adapter (£12 from Amazon) to plug the micro HDMI into an older but still serviceable 22 inch VGA monitor. For travelling only two connectors need to be unplugged. Alternatively only one connection is unplugged for tablet use.
I did hit a major problem downloading the optional but recommended updates for the Asus T100 from Windows update. Afterwards the wireless network wouldn’t work, nor would the sound driver. Only solution that I could find was to total restore Windows 8.1 from the Recovery drive. Fortunately this also includes the link to Activate Microsoft Office. Then I downloaded just the operating system updates and NOT the optional driver updates. System then worked fine. To update the drivers I downloaded latest versions from ASUS support and these worked fine. Before I installed updated drivers I updated the Bios to version 220 dated 2/12/2013. Everything has since worked smoothly. If you haven’t updated a bios before you may need the help of a teccy friend.
I deleted Asus web storage as they charge for it after one year. I replace Internet Explorer with Firefox with Adblock Plus and Better Privacy extensions. Installed CCleaner. Then did a Disk Clean-up to free space from old Windows updates (took ages). With Microsoft Office installed as well and OneNote removed (Google Keep I find is much better) there was XX free space.
I use the display with brightness turned to only about a quarter instead of full brightness, saves strain on eyes and battery.
Price is exceptional – in the U.K. Microsoft Home Office will cost £95 on Amazon, so think of the computer being £250 and that includes solid state storage. Not much but enough for everyday tasks and a tiny 64 GB memory card can be fitted for around another £38. Some reviews have commented about a noisy click on the touchpad, I agree although you do have the alternative of touching the pad to make a left click and there is a key function to view the right mouse options.
This was the processor/battery life/touch screen/price point that Windows 8.1 netbook/tablets needed. I highly recommend the is product unless you have applications that need large amounts of memory like video editing or PhotoShop. For Microsoft Office and web browsing on the move, or as a desktop with a larger screen, this device is well thought-out, well-made, and inexpensive.

B00G4E60UA,Evelyn Orwell,2.0,The Good And The Bad,18 December 2013,the United Kingdom,False,"There really isn't anything quite like a full windows 8 tablet that can run Skyrim with just a few performance mods.
Like any budget model, it is going to suffer from a few shortfalls. But I'm not going to talk about them, they are all over the internet in reviews (all generally quite positive). What I'm going to talk about is a defective product.
First being the worst, the keyboard does not stay connected to the tablet. At certain angles it simply isn't connected, I need to fiddle about with it, attach and reattach. Until it detects the keyboard. This is particularly intrusive when you have something like memory attached to the keyboards only full USB port.
Secondly, whenever the volume up physical button is pressed on the tablet, the computers volume then continues up to full as if being held down. The computer will then not stop to assume volume is full (even internally) until the physical down volume button is pressed. This error still applied when the device is in lock.

I'm still contemplating whether to return and replace it or not. This defects while annoying, can be lived with. But who knows how long it till take to get a replacement, considering I use it every day. (Returns are a hassle that I shouldn't have to cope with).

If the defects in my model did not exist, I'd probably rate this at a 4. Unfortunately I may soon have to return it.

B09BG83Q5S,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,30 May 2022,the United States,False,Mainly bought this for online classes and to run data analysis software on it. Works great! Screen is a little on the cheaper side (its one of those screens you have to tilt back to get a decent viewing angle) but its not really a concern for the purpose i use it for. I purchased the 17in model so the screen is large and works great with multiple open windows. Keyboard feels a little weird not much travel to the keys but again not a big concern. Don’t really game on it but I did download a few STEAM games and they worked and ran great. The processor handles them no problem. Mine came with WINDOWS 11 which I have grown to like (great multi-tasking features!) I think it’s a great mid-range laptop that’s great for students and office work. Might be a good choice for casual/amateur gamers that want to get into gaming without paying $1200+ but definitely invest in a keyboard and mouse if you’re trying to be serious about your gaming.

B0C1CTBL91,Amazon Customer,4.0,Decent budget Chromebook,28 November 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"I loved the idea of having a Chromebook with a full keyboard with number pad. But I wouldn't buy this again. I switch between using a normal keyboard for my work windows laptop, the laptop keyboard and this one. I mostly touch type (with the occasional glance down for some function buttons etc) and cannot get my bearings on this keyboard as it is a little cramped, the main keyboard part is skewed to the left (of course) and there's no gap between the return key and the number pad. So I can't ""feel"" my way around very well. They did centre the mousepad to the main keyboard which should aid use but I just really struggle. More than half the time I start typing absolute nonsense as I'm one key over and I have to start again.

Luckily I have a regular size acer Chromebook too so I use that if I need to type any significant amount (including this review) and mostly use this one for browsing and watching movies.

The sound is a bit tinny too and the plastic keys don't feel as premium as others but they are responsive. Think this is pretty much as you may expect from the price point though. The screen resolution, brightness etc and touchscreen are great.

Other things to note which may not be too clear from the product description:

- The keyboard is not backlit
- The screen lies flat but does not flip over - so there's no tablet mode (but it's too big for that really)
- it does have a headphone jack (as well as supporting Bluetooth connection)

If you are flying to the moon in 1969 that would be absolutely true. This is now however, so that is more marketing speak than reality. This is a modern computer, made with current tech that is designed to compete with Chromebooks and the MS Surface GO and the likes. By design, it is meant to heavily depend on the cloud (specifically OneDrive) and offer high portability to students and others with high text data needs.

Most people try to see a computer as a single entity, but really they are always two-hardware/firmware and software. The only thing here that you can change hardware wise is the hard drive. I have yet to pop the back off my brand new machine, but from what I have read online, there is either a standard laptop SSD (probably not) or a newer style NVME drive (I expect). In either case it can be changed out fairly easily if the cloud isn't doing it for you. 128 gb won't go very far if you go beyond mail, web and word processing, but will be more than sufficient for a great number of modest, utility type users.

Where most will be limited by this machine is the Windows S configuration. The ""S"" is for security, and from that aspect, it probably does the job and if that is what you are after (for your budding young adult, for example), it will fill the bill. You can (MUST!) get your needs fulfilled from the MS Store as everything there is vetted for safety and security. Again, if the majority of your work is in Office 365 and MS Edge, you may be just fine here. If you want to break out of that though, S has to go. Simple utilities like KeePass and Notepad++ (fully functional) are not there. There may be compatibles that you will be comfortable with, but the originals are not available in S. Leaving S is very easy (search for it) but of necessity is a one-way move since you could contaminate the architecture without the designed security. I saw no reduced performance when changing to the offered ""Home"" Windows 10. The change is almost instantaneous and free.

I have always turned up my nose at 14 inch laptops, but the narrow bezel, and changing the zoom from the default 150% to 125% has really made things work for me. I still desperately miss the number keypad, but USB versions and large docking stations are easily and economically available should you want to go that route. The touch screen coupled with the large (largest I've used) trackpad is starting to break my marriage to a mouse. My cheap iPad stylus (the kind with the clear disk on the end as well as the rubber ended kind) works just fine here, but if you need pressure sensitivity and buttons to click you'll need the dedicated Lenovo Pen.

A quick note about the other reviews I see here. They are riddled with inaccuracies and biases. Do your own research, far beyond what you see here. I usually don't put a lot of faith in pro reviews as they are often part of a sales technique, but I have to say they will serve you better than the ""helpful information"" you see here.

Consider this machine for what it is, and not what you want it to be and I think you'll find all is well here. Recommended.

If you found my comments useful, please consider clicking ""helpful"". Thank you.

B08L5KHHWL,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,30 March 2021,the United States,False,"Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i 14"" Convertible Laptop Is not a totally new concept. Open the screen part way and it’s a laptop. Flip the screen completely over and it switches to tablet mode.

In terms of specifications, the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i 14"" Convertible Laptop is low to average. It has an FHD (1920 x 1080) Touch Screen Display, an Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB DDR4 RAM and a 128GB SSD. It’s not a screamer by any means, but it gets the job done for typical home tasks.

The Lenovo’s IdeaPad Flex 5i 14"" Convertible Laptop is larger and heavier than I what I had expected for a 14” laptop. My Dell XPS-13 is a fraction of the size and weight and much thinner, but it has a somewhat smaller screen and it isn’t a convertible. In addition, the Lenovo’s screen is dim outdoors even in the shade and even with full brightness.

The Lenovo IdeaPad Laptop runs Windows 10 in S Mode. The “S” doesn’t stand for “Super” or “Special.” S Mode is a limited, locked down version of the Windows 10 Operating System. Microsoft states that S Mode is a faster, more protected version of Windows. And that may be true, but Windows 10 S also prohibits installing any application that weren’t downloaded from the Windows Store. The only Browser that can be installed is Edge. Google Chrome and Firefox may not be run. This is rather restrictive at least for me. Fortunately, Microsoft allows users to change the Windows version from Windows S to Windows Home without charge (for this model.)

Just to see what would happen (and because I need to install apps that do not come from the Microsoft Store) I switched the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i 14"" Convertible Laptop out of S Mode to Windows Home. The change is well documented on the Net and YouTube. Be aware that the process of switching isn’t hard, but it is not possible to switch back from Windows Home (or any other Windows version) to S Mode. This change is strictly one way. Once it’s done, it can’t be undone.

Maybe it’s just me, but I’m not a fan of Windows Tablet Mode. It always seems to be awkward and forced and very much unlike an iPad or am Android tablet. Maybe I just need to get used to Windows way of doing a tablet. Nevertheless, with the Lenovo’s IdeaPad Flex 5i 14"" Convertible Laptop it doesn’t matter as much since I can have it either way.

The computer played YouTube during 10:30 hours. I was really impressed. The I charged it completely in the next day. It took 1:40 h to be completely charged, Awesome.
2. Display: I am maybe somewhat naif, but I have never had a display experience such as with this computer. It gives you a sort of a '3D image'. Incredible. I showed it to my wife to be sure of what I was seeing, and she told me she had the same perception as well. Very nice. YouTube good recordings have an excellent resolution on screen.
3. Keyboard: although the layout of the keyboard is a 'classical' LeNovo layout, its touching is really smooth, with a kind of a rubbering sensation at the fingers. Typing is very responsive. The only thing I didn't like is that LeNovo switched the positions of Ctrl and Fn keys. In my previous (still in use and very good) LeNovo Flex 5, the position of these two keys are inverted. Why LeNovo did this?
4. Touchpad: the touchpad is incredibly responsive as well. Smooth and pleasant to touch. However, be aware to have clean hands before using the computer. After a few days, the touchpad had a greasy spot in it which is not easy to clean. This is maybe of my fault.
5. Web browsing: I don't like Microsoft Edge very much (although I have to try it again). Therefore, I downloaded and installed Chrome. Browsing the web with Chrome is very fast.
6. USB ports: the ultrabook has two USB ports. Transferring a folder of 62.2 Gb with 304 movie files from a Toshiba Canvio Connect II 1TB Portable Hard Drive to the ultrabook took 8 min. 23 sec.. Transferring back from the ultrabook to the external hard disk took 15 min. 33 sec. I also installed and connected an EPSON L3150 printer to the ultrabook. Printing just work fine.
7. HDMI port: I did connect a LG external screen through the HDMI port, and it did work fine as well.
8. Wireless mouse: I did connect a wireless mouse through one of the USB ports, and it did work very well.
9. Internet connection: I did a test with an internet speed of 24.85 Mbps for download and 6.00 Mbps for upload. I downloaded a 12 Gb folder with documents from Dropbox, and it took 44 min 46 sec. I then uploaded a folder of 60.7 Gb to the transfer file website WeTransfer, and it took 3 min 00 sec. Streaming connection and playing was very fast.
Starting the computer with the digital recognition is perfect.
The ultrabook has one drawback in my opinion: the on/off button on the right side is a bit small and needs to be seen, at least to me.
My overall experience with this ultrabook after 4 days of use is that it is extremely good. Congratulations to LeNovo for building a state-of-art ultrabook, which is very light in weight. They could provide a protecting case for the ultrabook, though, considering its price. It would have been a nice purchase gift. Nevertheless, the computer is worth its price. Hopefully the battery life will remain somewhat constant for over a year. My last laptop (LeNovo Flex 5) lost maybe half of its battery life after one year.

The seller in the meantime asked me to remove the negative review after I reached out to Amazon about being charged $132 restocking fee. The seller said it was for the cardboard container on the laptop. Seriously. I checked the seller ratings before I bought this laptop to decide which one to buy. I think other people do too and the reviews should reflect the actual product and purchase experience. In my experience the laptop would not work it would not connect to the Internet. I had two other laptops open connected to the Internet. I downloaded and watched a Lenovo set-up video. I did troubleshooting. I contacted my Internet provider to make sure that I had the right password. It would not connect. I was excited about this laptop. This was a big expenditure for me.

B0D3PVMR6G,M Fowler,5.0,very impressed for the price.,11 October 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"What a nice quality laptop for the price! Very well packaged and presented, with literature in proper English. There is even a spill membrane across the keyboard so the insides of the unit have some protection... It's so thin that at first I did not even notice it.
Spec wise, it's all you need for web browsing and basic Office documents and felt quite quick on those tasks. It was already set up for immediate use which was nice, and with a quick change of time zone and county code, all was well. For me, it will be the one I keep in the van and down at my workshop where those tasks are all that I need away from home. The keyboard will take a little getting used to with no number pad and a half height return key, but those are the compromises that come with the small form factor. No mistake though, it's a huge step up from trying to do those tasks on a smartphone, and I find I am enjoying using it. I can even see it keeping the grandkids entertained with simple games and videos. Great for the price.",0
B0D3PVMR6G,Sad Muppet,4.0,Good laptop for school.,9 October 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"I'll start this with saying this is NOT a gaming laptop - if you expect to game, this isn't the laptop for you.

It comes well packaged and I was genuinely surprised to see a mouse included in the box, which is a first. The laptop had some charge in it when it arrived, so that was handy. It can be opened wide to an almost flat state as well and has a little door on the underneath, presumably for RAM upgrade.

Switching it on, it came pre-installed with Windows and a version of Microsoft Office. Popping the browser up after I connected to the Wifi gave me a reasonably speedy experience, certainly good enough for my young one to be able to do their homework and research from without needing to use my desktop.

Build wise, it's fine. It's not ruggedised in any way, but it is trim and light which means should he have to use a laptop at school, this isn't going to weigh him down either.

For the price, this is one of the cheapest laptops I've seen - it's certainly better than having a Chromebook and means that the young'un has his own PC for his schoolwork in a lightweight package. Yes there's better laptops, but they are higher costs, so keep that in mind expectation wise, but for a cheap entry level laptop, this is perfectly fine.

B083T1S6Q4,Ivor Shed,4.0,Nearly as good as I expected,19 June 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"Having had countless HP laptops over the years, I knew it would be high quality, well built and reliable. I am very pleased with it but one thing must be pointed out to less experienced customers. This laptop came with Windows 10 Home, as stated. However it was in fact Windows 10 Home S Mode. This is new to me, having retired from IT Support some years ago, and I wasted several hours of my life getting S Mode disabled. For those who haven't heard of it either, S Mode is a new feature from Microsoft, which limits you to installing only applications from the Microsoft Store. This excludes Chrome and Firefox, so desperate are MS to get us all using Edge and Bing rather than Chrome and Google. You can switch it off, but it wasn't easy to find out how. PLEASE, HP and Amazon, if you must include S Mode in the installation of Win 10 home, please provide clear instructions to disable it, or switch it off before sending it out. I am left wondering how MS have managed to install this anti-competitive restriction by default, and can only hope, for the sake of the sanity of other customers, that the courts soon stop them doing so. This only loses the laptop one star in this review, but a beginner might just assume Chrome and Firefox have disappeared for good, or get even more frustrated than I did while trying to switch it off. Play fair, please.",273

B083T1S6Q4,jonah whale,1.0,Doesn't work,29 May 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"Laptop doesn't connect to the internet properly. Continuously disconnects even though wireless connection is on full power and laptop is connected to it. I believe other users have had the same issue. The support is a quagmire and I hope I get fully refunded but I doubt it as I already 'personalized' it by adding security (I didn't bother I've accepted a huge loss from this company)
It has the most unsatisfying on button - you really don't know if you've turned it on.
It doesn't go to 'sleep' properly but instead turns it self off - worse it has trouble restarting from sleep position
It has the worst keypad for writing (I'm a writer) I've ever used right back unto zx spectrum - it's like the keypad has been put together from broken parts. Like all bad products it LOOKS good but functions awful.
The port for a mouse is for left handed people - so if you're left handed it will be good for you.
It has not ethernet port.
The fan is VERY LOUD.
It has windows 10 which everyone knows is not the best. You have to spend a long time closing off all the restrictions placed on you by windows 10 such as the ability to run your own software and security.
Since writing my review there are more faults. The left button on the inbuilt mouse/pad area doesn't work properly, it's so clunky it makes the mouse move when you press down on it.
Also when leaning on the edges of the laptop to write it makes the mouse move and it affects the curser in writing documents, so it becomes impossible to write unless I hover my hands over the keyboard.
So I have to use this laptop for being online and my old laptop for writing still. SHOCKINGLY POOR QUALITY.
I bought this laptop as my old one was an HP and worked great. It's better than this one and this one is 10 years newer.

B093RNV6SD,BrizzleLass,5.0,Excellent value for money,19 April 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"I purchased this laptop so that I could study when travelling. I needed it to run Microsoft 365 apps and connect to the internet, and it works perfectly for these things. Spotify runs on it without a problem, and I can connect Bluetooth headphones (although the speakers work reasonably well).

I wouldn't recommend gaming with this as the processor and graphics card aren't up to it, but I have a larger laptop for that, anyway.

I'm not keen on the keyboard; the apostrophe isn't in the right place, so as a touch typer, I press enter instead of the apostrophe every time, which is a little annoying. I have a Bluetooth keyboard, though, which works with this laptop perfectly when I'm doing a lot of typing.

It is a bit slow at times and can get quite hot with prolonged use but overall for the price paid, it's fantastic value.",8

B07HZ377MN,CSTraining,5.0,Little beauty of a machine - We've become quite good friends :),22 January 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"This thing is a little beauty. I travel a lot and work from my laptop. Its so refreshing to pull this out and get to work in seconds without waiting 20 minutes for my other windows laptop to kick itself into action.

Its small but not too small as I can still type quick enough without tripping over my own fingers - this was probably the biggest worry for me. But no problems.

Infact, my windows laptop now looks and feels like I've just sat down infront of cinema screen - how I dealt with that for so long is a mystery to me 😂

You dont have all the windows apps obviously but google docs and sheets sorts those problems out. And if youve got anything saved on your Dropbox for example it'll automatically open it up in the relevant google app in seconds.

Id recommend buying a case to keep it safe aswell as the black finish will pick up scratches if youre not careful.

Someone commented on the the quality of videos on Netflix. Not sure what theyre talking about - no problem for me.

Overall im happy as hell with my purchase and finally not embarrassed anymore pulling out my gigantic lump of awkwardness (the old laptop) when I go to the coffee shop to work :)

If you're interested, just buy it already. Youll be happy you did

B07HZ377MN,T J A,5.0,Fit for purpose,8 January 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"Having moved away from Windows, I was pleasantly surprised at the whole Chromebook experience. I travel a lot (or used to) and only require limited apps relating to word processing/spreadsheets/presentations and moderate browsing use. This is perfect for what I need. I was on a 9-hour flight last year and still had battery life on arrival. Most planes have power facilities, but when In West Africa, without such luxuries, I had plenty of juice and was able to recharge from a solar unit. Google docs etc are a suitable alternative to Office apps, but MS Office on-line works fine. Even in the depths of northern Ghana, I used my mobile phone as a hot spot and was able to access Google Drive and Dropbox. I found the HDMI port useful and despite always wanting to upgrade to a newer and more powerful laptop, I actually can't justify it as this little machine does everything I need. Yes, it is a bit cheap and cheerful in many ways, but, hey, you get what you pay for and a far more expensive Windows machine is sitting in my cupboard having been retired.

B0CB1LWC55,Mayur Surani,5.0,"Performance, Display, Build Quality and Design",3 April 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"""I recently purchased the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 514IRL8 in Cloud Grey, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way possible. First off, the design and build quality are top-notch. The laptop is incredibly sleek and lightweight, making it perfect for on-the-go use without sacrificing durability.

The 14-inch Full HD display is stunning, with vibrant colors and crisp detail. Whether I'm watching movies, working on documents, or browsing the web, the screen never fails to impress. The slim bezels also contribute to an immersive viewing experience.

Performance-wise, this laptop is a powerhouse. The Intel Core i7 processor with a clock speed of up to 4.9 GHz handles multitasking effortlessly, and the 1 TB SSD provides ample storage space while ensuring lightning-fast boot times and application launches.

One of the standout features of this laptop is its integrated Intel graphics with 16 GB of dedicated GDDR6 VRAM. Whether I'm editing photos, playing casual games, or streaming content, the graphics performance is smooth and lag-free.

Battery life is another area where the IdeaPad Slim 5 shines. I can go through an entire day of work or entertainment without needing to recharge.

On top of all this, the laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Home, providing a secure and user-friendly operating system experience.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 14IRL. It offers exceptional performance, stunning visuals, and portability, making it the perfect companion for both work and play.""

B0CB1LWC55,TB.,4.0,"High quality, high performance but soldered RAM!",5 January 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"I've been searching long and hard for the right laptop for a while now, and when this one was on sale I didn't hesitate even though it wasn't exactly what I wanted in terms of specification. If this one would have either 16gb ram soldered or at least 8 with the option to upgrade to 16, it would have been perfect. I also wanted a 14 inch screen as I feel that 15.6 is too large, and I wanted a nice screen to boot.

There were a few deal breakers on my list of requirements, one being USB-C charging, second, low to no fan noise, and the other being a nice screen. There were many nice choices around my price range with all but the full function USB-C port. Having USB-C charging means I can basically charge anywhere without having to lug around a massive brick as you'd be hard pressed to go anywhere these days that's more than ten metres away from a phone charger or power bank.

This machine has all three, but I had to settle for 8gb ram. Initially this was also a deal-breaker, as many YouTubers are happy to state that 16gb is a must and any lower will result in your laptop melting into a puddle when browsing with more than one browser tab open, but on checking my work laptop spec which is a Lenovo ThinkPad, it too has 8gb of ram and I regularly have up to eight Chrome tabs open (a couple of those being Excel Online spreadsheets), Microsoft Teams and a couple of offline Excel spreadsheets on top of that without issue.

On removing it from its very simple packaging, I was happy to find that it is supplied with a 100w charger as opposed to the 65w I was expecting as this isn't stated on the Amazon product page as far as I could see. It charges very quickly and the plug appears to be secure in the port while moving around but time will tell how it lasts. The brick of the charger is small and the cables are plenty long enough but the brick does get rather hot as is expected with higher watt chargers. That's all that's in the box, one laptop and one charger.

The aesthetics of the machine also played a part in my decision to buy, and it does look quite nice with its blue casing. The lid is aluminium (fingerprint magnet!), and reminds me of the styling of older MacBooks, close inspection revealed a tiny scratch on it but nothing that can be seen without holding it at a specific angle so I'm not concerned. The main body is a matt plastic, which has a rougher texture to it and feels better than cheap laptops in my opinion. The hinge feels good, but right now can't be opened with one hand although this may change with a bit of use.

The casing is solid, and doesn't flex when weight is applied even in the middle of the keyboard which feels nice to type on and as far as I can see in reviews Lenovo laptop keyboards are considered to be some of the best. It is backlit, which is another feature that I like as I use computers in quite dark conditions a lot of the time.

Turning it on, I was surprised by the quality of the screen even with the prior knowledge that it was OLED. It is bright and sharp at 1920x1200 16:10 and in normal indoor use I'm finding that 55% brightness is more than enough and lower than the 60% long-term that most people who know recommend to avoid image retention. On that front, I'm not too concerned but it is in the back of my mind knowing that this can be a limitation on this type of panel. Having the correct power saving settings for screen timeout etc. should be enough to keep this at bay, but I'd like this laptop to last a good few years so I'll do all I can to maintain the quality of the screen.

During the usual Windows setup and bloatware removal (there's not a lot to be fair, Lenovo mostly, but also Mcrapee) I was expecting to hear a lot of fan noise as older laptops I've used were terrible, but was pleasantly surprised. In normal use, there's nothing. Not a peep. The underside gets warm slightly during charging and CPU load but the keyboard and palm rest are even cooler.

The camera is Windows Hello compatible, and most of the time logs me in the instant the lid is opened which is a nice feature to have in the absence of a fingerprint reader for login. The trackpad is nice and accurate so far, with the far left for scrolling brightness and far right for volume.

Battery also appears to be good, writing this review in notepad at 55% brightness (SDR) and balanced power plan, Windows reports 54% battery and 11h29m remaining which is obviously not accurate but using it off battery here and there I haven't needed to charge it in 24 hours. Idle (sleep) battery drain is very low and I don't think that it dropped more than a few percent over night.

In the couple of days that I've been using it, I'm more than happy with its performance but I do wish that the ram was upgradeable and the fact that manufacturers are still soldering it onto the board in 2023 is ridiculous. Dropped star for that, otherwise it would have been a five.

Note: Windows started automatically encrypting the drive after initial setup, so ensure that you have a copy of your encryption key or you turn off device encryption as soon as you can. BitLocker IS only available in Windows Pro versions, but a more limited version is still used in Windows Home to encrypt the drive.

Also worth a mention as I don't think that there was any on the Amazon page, the machine comes with three months of Game Pass Ultimate. Bonus.

Pros:

Nice looking
Durable feel
Nice screen
Nice keyboard
Silent in my usage
Good battery
USB-C full function

Cons:

8gb ram
Soldered ram!

B0CB1LWC55,Amazon Customer,1.0,Disappointing screen resolution and cannot connect to 4k screens.,13 June 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"I am most disappointed with this laptop ( Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 | 14 inch Full HD OLED Laptop Intel Core i7-13620H | 16GB RAM | 1TB S). I received it today, sending it back tomorrow. The screen is very bright, very vibrant but very pixelated. I am typing this review on my old computer that has noticeably better sharpness than the new one. It would not be an issue as I have 2 4K screens I could connect it to, but it does not display in 4k on ether of them (Samsung or Lenovo). The quality is very washed out and pixelated on the 4k screens - it is AWFUL to look at - I mean AWFUL. It is probably not Lenovo, but Windows 11 - who knows. Either way, I cannot recommend to someone who is hoping to use it with external screens.

It is very quiet compared to my 7 year old laptop and it is very fast. I will give it that, but the screen is something you look at all the time. It just is not adequate. I cannot express how disappointed I am to have to send it back.

B07G8LZHCR,Moira Owens,5.0,A perfect laptop with exceptional customer service,17 November 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"I suppose buying a refurbished laptop is always a risk, but I am happy to report that my experience purchasing from Secondlife-it, covered by the Amazon renewed scheme has really opened my eyes: I am now a convert!!!!!
Being a long term Ubuntu Linux user I prefer buying a used high quality brand like Dell which has proven Linux support, rather than a cheap low grade unbranded laptop which has none. I ordered my 7280 from secondlife-it with a stated deliver time of 7 days, so I was very pleased when it was delivered in only two days, a promising start! The PC was packaged in perfectly acceptable generic packaging that ensured it was received in perfect condition. The laptop was described as “excellent condition” and I can confirm it was, no real cosmetic marks that I could see. The laptop was not fitted with any warranty seals, so I could not resist a quick peek inside (Corporate Dells are designed to be easily repaired and maintained). It was instantly obvious that this unit had indeed been expertly refurbished. The battery had been renewed (a 3 cell model), the CPU fan was spotless from dust, and the keyboard deep cleaned. The installed windows installation booted perfectly, and all was going well. A welcome bonus was the the screen fitted was a higher spec. than advertised, a full HD IPS option!, (to be fair to secondlife-it this upgrade would not have been obvious as all Dells have options chosen by the original purchaser) I tested battery life and the unit ran for over 5 hours (that battery was indeed new) Then I came to my first problem: sadly the @ key appeared to be faulty (attaching an external keyboard confirmed my doubts) Upon closer inspection it looked like the keyboard had been expertly refurbished from another language, that wouldn’t normally worry me but for the fact that it had this fault. So it was time to see what the support from secondlife-it was like. A message via the amazon message system had a same day response (my thanks to Michelle) who arranged a swap for my unit, and sure enough, just 48hrs later, the units were exchanged on my doorstep. Soon after exchange, Michelle dropped me a message to check all had run smoothly (Now that really is exceptional service!) The replacement unit was even better!!!! The screen was not HD this time (that’s OK, as per the advertised spec,) but the new battery is a 4 cell model, which now gives a tested battery life of 10hrs – Outstanding!! So, all in all, why was I worried about buying a refurbished laptop? The end result is a high quality, high specification, perfectly reliable computer that is a million miles better than an expensive unbranded low spec new laptop. You can easily guess where I’ll be going to get my next laptop!!

B07G8LZHCR,Geraldo Netto,3.0,double check when you receive it,11 April 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"Well, it's a refurbished laptop it was expected to not be in perfect order but:
- the 'a' letter on keyboard came broken => it's okay for me because I would replace the keyboard anyway
- the battery which was supposed to have 60 Wh, has 14.5 Wh (~25% of its capacity) => expected but I think it would be good to mention in the product description that battery can wearout anytime soon
- internally, it was dirty, the cpu thermal paste was dry which means that it can overheat and it may not allow the cpu to deliver its peak performance
- it has only 1 memory slot meaning that you cannot upgrade memory like most laptops (it's a limitation from the Dell, has no relation with the seller)

I have done the following:
- replaced the dried cpu thermal paste by arctic mx-4
- replaced the 8 GB RAM by 32 GB RAM (already had it from another laptop - Corsair CT16G4SFD824A.M16FH)
- replaced uk layout by brazilian portuguese layout (46 euro from aliexpress)

Opened cd/dv draw and I have never seen so much accumulated dust in a drawer before.

Edit tras 5 meses de uso: Sigue todo correcto pero hay ciertos aspectos que no me convencen:
1. La laptop tiene un error que si modificas el volumen dentro de un juego los fps caen casi a 0 por un par de segundos, mientras no lo hagas en medio de combate no pasa nada pero es un poco molesto.
2. Los 500 gb son poco para los estándares de hoy pero pues si le sabes puedes meterle otro SSD.

B0CWB2LWRN,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,6 February 2025,the United States,False,"I'd been lurking in laptop forums for a while trying to get a feel for the current market, and after a few months I'd decided to start doing some shopping. On paper, this machine is pretty entry level for gaming laptops. I was nervous about an AMD CPU but as it turns out, Intel LOQs are dying left and right. Then the 4050 was concerning because I didn't want to end up with budget performance and I knew the 4050 was the starter for the 40 series lineup. I did upgrade the storage with an additional 1TB SSD and the ram with 2 new 16GB sticks.

I'll put it this way. Boot times maybe about 10-20 seconds from shutdown. It runs cyberpunk on full max settings at about 20fps. Ray tracing ultra. If you knock the ray tracing back or disable it, it runs at 50+fps, all other settings ultra. Pretty impressive, frankly. For less demanding titles like Minecraft, it can run at the full 144fps to match the display. Planet Zoo? Runs like it's barely working up a sweat. Max settings, 80-100fps. Fortnite can get between 40 and 144 depending on your graphics settings. It emulates like a dream, regularly getting 70+fps for things like Breath of the Wild on a WiiU emulator, and being capable of frame generation, you can use apps like Lossless Scaling to implement frame generation anywhere you want it.

All of this, and it stays cool. It will warm up, but it's never been hot. It is a tad loud though. But for the price and the performance, that's a really good tradeoff. I'm happy with it, 100%

Fantastic screen, very fast and powerful enough to run things like solidworks or video editing software. No problem playing games either, Civ 6 I can have the graphics on full easily (although you'll need to be plugged in if you want to play for more than 30 mins like this).

Only downsides are:
Occasionally when you're plugged in it doesn't charge - you have to keep messing about plugging and unplugging and then it finally recognises its plugged and starts charging. Still unsure the cause.

Occasionally I've had an issue where it doesn't want to switch on, again no idea why. Just keep trying and it comes back. Seems to be related to the above issue too.

Seems the USB C ports can't be used for charging, only the proprietary cable, which is a big shame.

My particular unit I got from Amazon Warehouse, which was described as cosmetically damaged. There was only a small dint for a massive discount so I was extremely happy - I've found however that the headphone jack doesn't work. Becuase I got such a huge discount I didn't dispute this with amazon, but beware if you do the same.

B07YW4D875,J. M. Green,5.0,Nowt Wrong With This!,15 January 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"With Microsoft no longer supporting Windows 7, I was left in a bit of a quandry - do I replace my old Sony Vaio laptop or do I try the Linux route - and in light of the fact that I do have a company laptop (also Lenovo) and I own an iPad, what exactly did I need another laptop for.
Good question - well I am a bit of a dinosaur where modern tech is concerned - not scared of it, but always questioning why we have to have certain bits of tech, but in my office I do have two screens to work from so that when I am working from home, it is nice to have two screens too - so eventually decided that Linux was not for me and that yes, I would like a replacement machine without breaking the bank and, eventually, settled on the purchase of the AMD A9 V145 Lenovo machine.
Setting it up was a doddle and, moreover, migrating information etc from my old laptop was also very easy and, as for speed, well this machine having a solid state drive is very quick - indeed it registers even more quickly than my iPad, so it is fast! And, so far, everything is working very well indeed with a nice clear screen to boot!
However, and I do have to say this, compared to the Vaio, it is not made from very nice plastic and feels very flimsy - but there again what do you get from this segment of the market that is way below a grand to purchase? The plastics used are not very tactile and the touch pad is super sensitive to the point that even the lightest touch feels like it is going to make the pad crumple under the weight of the stroke! However, not being a fan of touchpads, I have also purchased a wireless mouse which resolves that particular problem and would certainly recommend this addition for less than a tenner.
On first starting the machine, I did plug it into the mains until it came up to 100% and then disconnected it to see what kind of off mains usage you can get - and the answer seems to be about 2 hours of Internet browsing. How it will perform with power hungry apps, I am not too sure but I am not that bothered as I am never far from a plug in point so 2 hours battery life is fine by me - but for those with high power usage, this might be an issue
Obviously, it is early days yet, but if I get anything like near the wear and tear that I got from my beloved Vaio, then this will have proven to have been a rather good buy

Addition 05/01/2021 - 12 months on since my original purchase and this machine hasn't let me down at all. The battery life remains around about the 2 hour mark, but that is not a problem for me as I usually plug it straight in before I switch it on but this aspect may be of concern for those who need it to operate in isolation with power hungry applications.
The build quality remains my only concern, so I do tend to treat it a little with kid gloves, unlike my Vaio that was pretty much bomb proof in it's construction. But that all said, I remain very pleased overall with my purchase and certainly would not hesitate to recommend this machine to anyone considering a machine from this end of the VFM sector of the market!

Addition 05/01/2022 - And another year goes by and my Lenovo is still hitting it's stride each and every day and running for at least 9 hours a day with no failures and nothing falling off. I was concerned about build quality but I have been proven wrong. It may feel a tad flimsy but it is certainly staying the course...VFM it sure is... and here's to another 12 months of failure proof use!!

Addition 10/02/2022 - Well, still very stable with nothing falling off although I have experienced a situation wherein the battery went normally down from 100% to around 64% and then, without warning, dropped off of a cliff and shutting down. When plugged back in and restarted, the battery was showing as zero power. Then, after fully recharging returns to normal with the battery being run from 100% down to just under 10% with no mishap. Whatever the issue is, it is something that you can't repeat on demand but this has happened three or four times inside the last 6 months....just something to be aware of is all as you could potentially lose everything that was on screen at the time the power fades off that cliff!

Addition 25/04/2023 - The battery situation rectified itself but lo and behold, another issue has emanated! When on battery power only if the machine lies idle and it goes into ""sleep"" mode, you cannot recover the screen as it will not light back up unless and until the machine is plugged into the mains. Even when the battery is then showing as full, to remove the plugged in power source results in the screen loss, therefore the machine now has to sit constantly plugged in (although by closing the machine completely and bringing it back up again, I can use the machine unplugged until again it needs recharging at which point, the fault re-emerges!!)....not in itself an issue but certainly an annoyance.....particularly as my ancient Vaio, now being used purely as a storage machine, continues fault free! Such is modern tech heh!?

Addition 09/05/2024 - the above mentioned fault remains unresolved, but I have learned to live with it BUT seeing that I have now had a couple of messages from Microsoft informing me that they will stop supporting Windows 10 in October of 2025 and that this machine will not run Windows 11, that I will be needing to purchase a replacement machine......therefore this machine will become (as my Vaio, which continues to operate as it ever did!) a simple storage machine....!!

B09GKM9R1Q,Daniel,5.0,Great Laptop - screen is the best I have seen,15 August 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"This is a review of the ASUS Laptop Vivobook Pro OLED M3401QA
14 Inch 2.8K - AMD Ryzen 9-5900HX, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD

I have had a number of Laptops - from IBM, Dell Alienware - all good laptops but i have never used one with a OLED screen

Every time i use my work laptop or desktop - nothing compares to this screen - so in future I think this is a must have if you can afford it
Saying that, I bought this for 699 which was a good price for a pretty decent CPU and good RAM - shame RAM is not replaceable but I suppose all smaller Laptops are the same due to size restraints

One thing to note, as some else mentioned, The warranty from ASUS says my machine is out of date even though it is new - but to be honest, any issues, will go through amazon help line if ever needed

If you need a small Laptop - -with pretty good specs and a screen to beat all others - -would recommend this one

B09GKM9R1Q,Mark Laffin,5.0,Woah dat screen doh!,21 January 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"Wanted a decent laptop and was prepared to pay about £1000. Having read reviews and compared every manufacturer and laptop to death, I went with Asus, upon deciding that, I then came up with this little beauty, just less than 20% over budget, but htf, it's brilliant, I love it. The screen is ridiculously good, the colours really pop, watching nature programs or documentaries about the universe beautifully showcase the sheer gorgeousness of the screen. Screen Brightness, volume and backlights for keyboards can all be quickly and easily managed via use of the 'f' keys at the top of the keyboard. Getting used to the touchpad can be a bit tricky, but not impossible even if you're not used to it. This one however is reasonably intuitive (after a while). I do recommend a decent mouse and laptop tray to use it on. Volume output is very good but not altogether exceptional, however using earbuds etc will render lovely, smooth and more than adequately loud volume levels. Battery life is brilliant, one full charge should see you through at least one day of heavy use. Fans are barely audible through most usage and the laptop really gets more than warm, in fairness this is for moderately taxing applications, it may be worse when maxed out. All in all, if you are willing to part with slightly more than £1000, then look no further for a brilliant laptop for the money.",20

I purchased this item less than three years ago, and unexpectedly, it has ceased to function. I am unable to reach anyone to inquire about the availability of replacement motherboards. It is unreasonable to expect laptops in a specific price range to fail within such a short period, and it has become quite difficult to obtain the necessary parts for repair.

B09GKM9R1Q,CP,4.0,"Decent value, god capacity storage, works well, good screen, battery life could be improved",12 October 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"On the whole like this laptop a lot for the money. Storage (1TB) fast and good capacity, decent response, great colour screen, I prefer matte IPS screens, but despite being shiny this one doesn't reflect as much as I feared and gives lovely colour rendition - though I had to tweak my browser settings ( using url edge://flags to enable forced colours and setting forced colours to sRGB ) so that the hdr didn't make some older web content look weird in screen shots - but once had done that - lovely colour all round. Decent sound for a laptop. Good, accurate and decent size touch pad, though, one minor niggle the touch pad number pad does turn itself on no and then for no apparent reason, which can interfere with input, - but easy to easy to turn off by simultaneously tapping both upper corner icons on the touch pad. The keyboard has a good layout, and is better than many, with a nice feel and the backlighting can be cycled through several levels of brightness using fn + f7 - most of the time I have the backlighting off but it's undeniably handy in low light conditions, though it's a bit ""twinkly"" at full blast !

It's light so I barely notice it on my back but the screen is definitely big enough that I can dual screen easily all the time.

I looked on Asus's website, in certain countries this laptop comes with a bag and a mouse, however in the UK you only get a charger.

B09GKM9R1Q,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,11 April 2022,the United Arab Emirates,False,"Do not trust that you will get the described features. ASUS are very liberal with their ""optional"" features classification and you have no guarantee that you will get a device matching the description.

I bought the blue i7+3050 option and it took so long to debug why the fingerprint sensor is not working with the help of ASUS service employees only to find out that I got a laptop /without/ the fingerprint sensor.

Also, even with the latest windows updates (as of 11/04/2022) you will not get Bluetooth devices to work well because of driver issues. You will need to install MediaTek Bluetooth drivers 1.723.0.164 WHQL manually. That is, of course, if you get a device with the same bluetooth card cause ASUS apparently like to mix and match their laptop configurations with no transparency.

B09GKM9R1Q,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,5 March 2023,Saudi Arabia,False,"I disliked one thing about this device - the battery life. When I first bought it with Windows 11, it would only last for an hour before needing to be charged again. However, when I downgraded it to Windows 10, it improved and lasted for around three hours. Additionally, I put some stickers that came with it on the device, but they scratched the color around the touchpad, making it darker than the original dark blue. Unfortunately, the laptop screen is now broken because my friend accidentally stepped on it. The cost to repair the screen is around 60% of the original price, so I am considering replacing the laptop entirely. Despite there being some great features on the device, I couldn't fully enjoy them as all these issues occurred within a year of owning it.",0

Battery life is poor you'll be lucky to game on this for any more than an hour before needing to plug in but this is to be expected from a gaming laptop.
A cooling pad is a must for this laptop. I was regularly getting CPU temps into the mid 90s. I contacted HP support regarding this and the guided me through a BIOS update.

My last laptop was 10 years old (hence the replacement) and I am finding this can do stuff I haven’t done before. It is very responsive and I need to get used to this and I know it will be great for playing active games. I do love playing computer games and that is one reason I chose this computer.

B00S63RJ9S,Dave R,5.0,Best laptop I've ever used,27 February 2016,the United Kingdom,False,"I needed to replace my dead HP mini netbook & I had specific criteria for it. Small enough for it be used whilst sat on my knee in a vehicle (I spend a lot of time sat in a vehicle in obscure locations & a full size laptop is no use in these instances), so a 12.5"" was the maximum size I could go to. A good battery life, as I'm away from a mains outlet & didn't want to have to start carrying a charging cable with me. Preferably a SSD drive for faster start-up & lighter weight. A non-reflective screen as it was going be used primarily in a vehicle & didn't want be looking in a mirror. A solid build was essential, as it was going to lugged around & chucked into the back of the vehicle & carried in a rucksack, sometimes on a motorcycle.

When I bought the HP Mini in 2010, netbooks were ten a penny - five years later, the market has shrunk massively due to the popularity of tablets. A tablet is no use to me - I use Office Word & Excel a lot & I can imagine it'd be a nightmare to use on a tablet. I struggle with a tablet keyboard - I've tried, but for me, they don't have the same feel. Plus, with a clamshell design, the keyboard sits on your knee & the screen can be angled to the best position. I also need to be able to plug into two or three USB ports, which you don't get with tablets & the memory on a tablet is nowhere big enough for my requirements.

So when I started to look round, I was surprised at how limited the choice was that met my requirements. The biggest drawback was limited battery life - 2-3 hours seemed to be the norm, with a few hitting 5-6 hours & even less with 7 hours plus. The first I bought was an Asus Transformer T200 - it seemed to be ideal - a tablet with a detachable keyboard. Only 64gb in the tablet, but the keyboard had a an extra 500gb hard drive. Good battery life seemed to make it an ideal choice. Unfortunately, it was terrible. It felt flimsy & very plasticky, but as it was £300, I could live with that. The biggest problem was the two-finger scroll function on the touchpad kept failing. Spent hours with Asus trying to sort it out, they eventually replaced it - same problem again, so I gave up.

I then started looking at more expensive machines & came across the Dell E7250. On paper, it ticked all the boxes - good battery life (quoted as 9 hours), anti-glare screen, 256gb SSD, magnesium alloy chassis, 3 USB ports & an SD slot. The keyboard is spill-resistant (to a degree) & can be ordered back-lit, which I had on my larger HP laptop, & found to be a brilliant idea. However - you are stepping up in price - there are so many spec levels & add-ons, you can soon be over a £1000. I didn't want a touch-screen - I can see the point of them on laptop, & it only adds to the price & size. I ordered mine direct from the DELL outlet store - you have take what they have at the time, but the prices are good.

When it arrived it looked brand new - not a mark on it & came with a full three years manufacturers warranty. I have to say, this has to be the best laptop I've ever used - it's a pure delight. I'm not a techie - if you want an in-depth review, I suggest you read the one by notebookcheck.net, it goes into so much more detail than I ever could.

It feels solid you can tell they've used premium materials - no flex in the casing at all - I'm sure you could twist it if you wanted to, but not in everyday use unless you're really heavy handed with it the keyboard is responsive, the keys have a positive feel to their action. Fires up & ready to use in under a minute (via the fingerprint reader). Proper click buttons on the bottom of the keyboard ( unlike my HP Envy, which just has a ""Control Zone"" trackpad, & is an absolute nightmare to use). The keyboard back light has three settings, off, low or high - absolutely fantastic in a car at night when you don't want to blind the driver by having the interior light on. The screen can fold back flat so it's level with the keyboard - very useful compared to others where the screen has a limited adjustment. The SSD can be removed & replaced should it fail or need replacing with a larger unit. Battery life is enough for a full day for me - probably 7.5 hours of net-browsing, general office work, bit of video streaming - you can also buy a Dell Power Companion, which is like a mobile phone power pack, so can always add more juice if you need it.

I had a small issue after installing Windows 10 - Dells support line were fantastic & sorted the problem out over the phone. As I said, I'm not a techi, & there are plenty of reviews out, but if anyone has a specific question, I'll d my best to help.

All in all, this is a wonderful unit - I would dump my larger HP laptop & rely entirely on this one if I could - unfortunately, I need a larger screen for some of the work I do, but when the HP is ready to be replaced, I will look at a larger version of this.

B0D7HMYNYF,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,16 April 2025,the United States,False,"I'm quite surprised with this laptop so far. Especially when you consider the price.

Pros: 16 gig of RAM and a 1TB drive with back-lit keyboard. It's fast, the display is a perfect size, and I've been putting this laptop through its paces as a music computer. So far, so good!

Cons: not sure what the deal is with the speakers but they are pretty bad. They claim stereo, but the speakers are so close together, there is just about no stereo spread and they aren't that loud. Not that we need laptop speakers to be great as just about all of them are weak, but these are by far the worst I've experienced. I had to buy a clip on stereo speaker which sounds fantastic.

Wifi: it's one of the slowest wifi laptops I own. I have a lightning fast connection here and right at my router, I can't get this to download faster than 250mb per sec. But it still does the job.

Lastly, the worst part of this laptop is the battery. It drains so fast, it's actually sad. They really had something here but failed on one of the most important things on a laptop. You can literally watch the battery go down. I've had to use power saver just so I'm not constantly charging this battery to the point of it no longer having charge capabilities.

Thankfully I don't need the laptop like others do. You would think with the cons I've supplied here that my review would warrant less stars. The truth is, for what this is, it's great. I wanted a back-lit keyboard, a 1TB drive and at least 16 gig of ram running windows 11. I got just that. I just really wish the battery was better and that's my biggest issue with this. Other than that, I've pushed this thing hard as a music computer and it's been great. I'd buy it again, however, I'd look and see if I could find something like it with longer battery life.

It boots quickly, is light, has a good battery life (no hard stats, sorry) and lets me choose whatever browser I want, just as any PC would. There are a few really annoying issues though.

First it has a proprietary charging adapter instead of USB-C like most other modern devices. This is a strange choice and will stink if I lose the adapter or it breaks. Second, the trackpad has absolutely no palm rejection whatsoever. If any body part touches the trackpad in any way, your cursor will go flying or you'll invoke an unintended gesture.

Third and the most annoying is the keyboard. The keys feel good but the layout is weird as if it was designed by someone who had a keyboard described to them but never used one. A lot of the control keys (arrows, home, end) are place just oddly enough that I hit arrow keys when trying to hit shift all the time. Delete is at the top of the number pad and I find I have to hunt for it all the time. It gets frustrating.

Finally, is there a way to turn on the key backlighting by default so I don't have to do it EVERY time I power on the PC? That gets old fast.

- Provided charger sparks when plugging into the mains (tried numerous sockets)
- 20% of the keys on the keyboard aren’t working which means you need an external keyboard to use the laptop
- Physical condition of the laptop is very, very, poor, it was covered in a badly aligned sticker in an attempt to cover cosmetic damage, and this had to be removed as it was sitting on the trackpad and rendered the trackpad unusable. The whole laptop looked in poor condition from a lot further than 30cm away. Scuffs and marks all over the body of the laptop.
- The black rim around the screen had corroded away and when shutting the lid offered no protection against the screen slamming down
- Laptop looked damage from further than 30cm away
- Battery life drained very fast during minimal use, and barely lasted a day on standby, far below the “guaranteed 80%” advertised.
- Laptop base got too hot to touch when under moderate load, too hot to have on a lap.
However, the seller did return a full refund no questions asked.
I’d recommend saving the hassle and skip this buy.

B08Q7QQ3K4,Kathryn Thacker,5.0,Great looking laptop with some capacity to game.,28 June 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"Good for admin and typing but there is an error with hp when gaming. Keys somehow programme to stay pressed even when you've lifted up and the key isn't stuck down. Found forums that say other spectres across the board do this.

It's a stunningly, beautiful design. It has lovely rose gold edges and the on button is descrete to the left on a tiny edge. It has a modern geo edge look. The quality is lovely. It is quick to turn on and load up.

It's screen is crisp and bright.

Battery life on this version is very good. There was a more expensive Amoled screen version that drains battery power quicker which I didn't opt for as it halfed the battery life from what this version can do.

I bought it to do some gaming on with Steam but I know there are cheaper gaming laptops that have better capacity for quality gaming than this. It will run what I need such as State of Decay, Banished, House Flipper and non-competative Call of Duty. The Asus Tuf would have served a gamer better for cheaper money but Spectre definitely wins on looks and general feel. It definitely stands out to many other laptops because it is different and more elegant to look at than usual gaming chunky laptops.

The screen goes right to the edge and the quality of picture is lush.

The tablet screen is handy and the stylus is good. It feels so lovely to use.

You can't hear it is on. It is very silent, I haven't had the fans kick in yet.

It is a little heavier than I expected to pick up but not the heaviest. It just looks thin but definitely has a weight to it.

Cortana greets you on start up and has some good lines of dialogue.

You can log in with face recognition or thumb print.

I am a touch typist and my speed has dropped slightly because the large enter key has been replaced by a small one but this is a minor issue to retrain my brain to.

It is easy to use and set up.

It is a beautiful laptop that does what most people, unless extreme gamers, need a laptop to do.

B08Q7QQ3K4,Nadia K,1.0,Screen didn't work,25 March 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"I was skeptical about the price point (£1096) being lower than RRP for a brand new laptop, so I confirmed that it was definitely new. However, it turns out it might not have been.

1) As soon as I bought it, there was an instant price jump to £1200 for the same product from the same seller.
2) The charger was not in the plastic casing (the plastic was under the open charger).
3) The screen never turned on at all - there was an accessibility voiceover set up instead.

I contacted Amazon tech support but they were unable to help, and the manufacturer support was not available on weekends, so I decided to proceed with a return instead. I suspect they will try to resell this to someone else so be wary.

(NB: This review is about the specific laptop that I bought, and not a review about all HP Spectres in general - I will still buy another one, but from a physical store where I can just go in and get a replacement).

UPDATE 17/04/23
Amazon received the return on 30 March. I still haven't received my refund. I have been asked to wait until 24 April as there is a 30 day waiting period for returns of high value items (They were unable to provide a link to any policy stating this).

I have bought another HP Spectre which works beautifully so far! Love the extra height!

Second update:
Turns out the battery in the new one is fake. Also bought from Amazon from a different seller.

B08Q7QQ3K4,Jim P,4.0,"Great laptop, however. . .",25 August 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"I purchased my first Spectre in 2016 which was as 13"" model. I wanted a larger screen so decided to go for this model. I spent a lot of time researching and almost went with the Dell XPS. I'm glad I chose the Spectre. Its superfast and doesn't get hot, except when it's doing a lot of updates - even on my lap it manages to stay only warm.

I knocked off one star because a screw was loose under one of the keys - this caused typing issues! I contacted HP Support and Amazon who offered to repair it, however I fixed it myself. Amazon did offer me a partial refund.

The one major gripe I have about this laptop is the keyboard backlight - after 30 seconds of inactivity on the keyboard/trackpad, it switches off even if the power supply is connected. Imagine working in a dark room and you want to resume typing! There is no way to configure the timeout. Great idea if you are working on battery supply, but not when the power is connected. Such a stupid design idea and it looks as though HP won't be providing an override feature anytime soon.

Pros:
- Keyboard and trackpad are a joy to use
- Excellent screen
- Windows Hello is A++
- Nice looking laptop
- Doesn't get too hot unless under heavy load
- Pen works well

Cons:
- Some bloatware that you might want to remove
- Prone to fingermarks, so make sure you keep it clean
- Keyboard backlight turn off after 30 seconds of inactivity on the keyboard/trackpad, even if the power supply is connected. No option to change this behaviour.

B09HVC79PC,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,15 February 2022,Saudi Arabia,False,"First of all, stay away from those Intel Celeron or AMD equivalent cheap laptops as they will never give you the best experience.

This laptop has a Ryzen 3 CPU with vega graphics which makes it enough to run everyday tasks. Applications run smooth like butter. The feel of the touchpad on this is something else. The keyboard is clickly and feels nice too. The only downside in this laptop is the soldered memory (4GB DDR4), with only one avilable slot to expand, which means dual-channel mode is out the window. It's still recommended to upgrade the memory as 4GB is barebone to run the operating system. The memory requires 260-pin module with 2400 MHz as this is the maximum clock speed the laptop can handle. SSD drive can be swapped out for more capacity, with an additional space for 2.5 inch for mass storage.

All in all, one of the best deals out there.",0
B09HVC79PC,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,10 August 2022,the United States,False,"The Acer Aspire 15 has been a super great laptop. It's probably one of the best tech purchases I have ever made and I'm an IT guy. I paid about $350 USD for this one and am very happy with the purchase. The last time I was searching for a Laptop I returned 5 laptops before I was satisfied so I'm pretty picky. This was for my wife but I use it at night when I'm not in my office sometimes.

Storage & Upgrades: Although it only comes with 128gb SSD & 4gb RAM it's no big deal for about $100 you can upgrade to 20gb RAM and 2tb HDD + 128gb SSD. I love that you can run dual drives. 1 SSD + 1 HDD. I added a 2TB HDD for Data Storage for $50, it came with the bracket in the box, and it didn't void the warranty, like on my LG Gram. The 128gb SSD is functioning as a Boot Drive. I also added a 16gb module for about $50 and now have 20gb RAM. The upgrades were pretty straightforward and you can use normal small screwdrivers.

Performance: It boots up super fast, maybe 10 seconds to reach the sign in screen and 2 seconds to log in. Web pages and programs load quickly. We use it for Web browsing, Word, PowerPoint & Excel. I'm not doing video editing or high performance gaming on this but it runs almost as fast as my i5 LG Gram that cost $1500 with all SSD drives. It doesn't get too warm but we do have it on a fan stand, but I don't usually plug it in because for some reason the USB keeps powering the fan after it powers down, and I can't find a BIOS setting to turn this off. I notice that it gets a little warm when sitting directly on a table. I usually can't hear the fan at all. Sometimes you can hear it kick on when you open up 15 tabs and a bunch of apps.

Screen: The screen is really nice too. It's 1080 Full HD so you don't see the pixels like on a normal 15"" Standard HD screen. I think it's average brightness but we use it indoors so it's plenty bright for our needs.

Keyboard: I love the Keyboard, it's much better than the keyboard on my LG Gram, and just as good as the best keyboards I have tested in BestBuy from Lenovo. It's wonderful to type on. It's backlit as well so that's nice plus. And I love the Number Pad, even though the number pad is a little skinner than the other keys.

Fingerprint ID: It's super fast and I didn't know how much I would love it!

Speakers: The speakers are fine. They are loud enough to watch YouTube videos and the news but it won't compete with a home stereo system.

Ports: It has plenty of full size ports: 3 USB, 1 USB C, 1 Full HDMI a headphone jack and even a RJ-45 Ethernet Port! I hate dongles so it's nice that you don't need one for this laptop. I would have liked to see a MicroSD reader but my wife doesn't SD Cards it so it's no big deal for her.

Window 11: It comes with Windows 11s but is very easy to switch to standard Windows 11. I was a little concerned about this and it almost made me not go for this laptop. But it's no big deal, as soon as you try to install something ""non Microsoft"" like Google Chrome it says something like, ""If you want to install non-Microsoft software, you have to switch to full Windows 11 mode. Are you sure? You will loose all the exclusive Microsoft Security with Windows 11s Mode."" But you just click, ""Yes"" and it switches, it may require a reboot but I can't remember.

Battery: The battery is average. We usually leave it plugged in on the desk but the few times that we have used it without a battery we used it for a few hours and it remained at 70% battery. Windows 11 doesn't estimate the time remaining so I really don't know for sure how long it would last. I'd guess it would go from 100% to 10% in about 5-6 hours for Netflix, YouTube or web browsing or MS Office apps.

Again, I really love this laptop. I keep telling my wife how impressed I am with the performance, storage upgrade options, keyboard, screen, etc. She doesn't really care that much as long as it works fast and does what she wants so I decided I had to tell all of you Amazon people that this is a great laptop for 95% of normal people who just want something that works well and is a good price. I highly recommend the acer aspire 15 and would buy it again, no regrets!

B09HVC79PC,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,2 February 2024,the United States,False,"This laptop was unfortunate enough to be bought by a gamer, and yet it's still standing, rage quit fueled keyboard smashes and all. I'm surprised how much abuse this thing has taken but come out completely unscathed. It's a really nice little computer, it just gets a little whiny when you try to put Sims 4 (with tons of expansion packs on it) but it runs Goat Simulator, Untitled Goose Game, Robocraft, Undertale, Doki Doki Literature Club, etc. without any issues. I have not tried World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Valorant, Overwatch, or Minecraft on this, so you'll have to test it out yourself. I have no complaints about this laptop, it's now somehow my school computer AND a bit of a gaming laptop. I've taken it everywhere, even to the hospital. The speakers are great, it doesn't heat up quickly or that bad, the fan doesn't overwork itself, the memory is nice and spacious, it's very fast when loading anything, especially while booting up, and I'm even writing this review on it. The keyboard is nice and thin but not too thin. It's definitely worth the money, even more imo. There is a built-in camera, and it's not that bad. Oh, and the audio quality is apparently *chef's kiss* according to the boys on discord. It runs discord beautifully, btw. Screensharing is easy with this computer. I couldn't get OBS to run very smoothly on this laptop, so I'll have to troubleshoot that. Otherwise, this is probably THE perfect laptop. 98/10, genuinely. This computer has become a vital part of my life, it's basically another one of my internal organs at this point. I'd buy several of these. Why several?

I have asked for replacement they refused in Amazon and said repair or refund. Disappointed with this laptop and disappointed with Amazon as they refuse to replace it so be careful when buying expensive electric gadget with them as they should replace it as hustle for refund and also if faulty should be replaced not repaired as the fault will continue. . I have decided not to buy from Amazon any electric good as they refuse to replace even it is only two weeks with me. unfortunately it is more than ten days and did not even received the refund which I have to chase them as well and I have wasted a lot of time chasing them to replace and now to chase them getting my refund. so be careful when using amazon for expensive goods and I hope they should change there policy as they will lose many customers.,2
B08PGJD254,Manuel Ruiz,4.0,Great Laptop HP but something different,10 October 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"The laptop as overall is great, it is very powerful, and I really don't understand the bad reviews. It's true that it has some things that could be improve.
The screen is HD is 1920Hp but with 13"" you are not going to be able to have a better quality image, so in this aspect i am very happy so nothing else to say. The sound is also brilliant comparing with my low end HP laptop, but is not as good as Apple laptop for example, but I am very happy because is still a good audio signed by Bang & Olufsen.
The laptop has a very high speed in all the situations if you are already using and also if you are switching on the laptop, with the same speed that we have in a macbook pro, I have to say that these aspects are normally changing with the time of use. At the moment is very fast, so nothing to complain after some months of use, the 16gb of ram help to have this smooth feelings.
The hard drive with 1TB is fairly enough for most of the mortals I think in a normal way of use.
The bad things that i can see in this laptop are:
*Bad things*
1. The screen reflect the light so is difficult to use it if you are outside in a sunny day.
2. The retro-illumination in the keyboard is strange sometimes, for example some parts like the space doesn't have light.
3. The battery should last a little bit more, is not amazing, and the charger charged 50% in 30 min is true but for the 100% is taking ages!!
And that's all, in general is a very good computer but as always is depend on how much it cost, in my personal case I saw an offer and the computer was 800£ in that case it worth it. But i would say, this laptop is not worth more than 1000£.

B0B31J9DM3,Mr Hahn,5.0,Read this before purchasing any of the screens.,20 July 2019,the United Kingdom,False,"I've purchased two of these screens now. One of them was sent back. Here's why...

First, Asus has multiple completely different screens in one listing here. The different size names correspond to completely different model numbers. Make sure you research each model before purchasing to know what you're getting.

I'm a tech contractor that often works from hotels, on the road, on airplanes-etc. I run a Windows work laptop (with a USB-C port) and an older 2015 Retina Macbook Pro (with thunderbolt 2 and USB 3.0 ports).

I initially purchased the ASUS MB169C+ due to reviews here, but quickly found that while the screen worked fine on my windows laptop via a USB-C to USB-C cable, connecting it to my Mac with an Anker Powerline USB 3.0 to USB-C cable (as recommended in other reviews here) didn't work. The screen requires too much power to operate on USB 3.0 and you get a flashing white light to signify this when plugging it in to any machine via a USB 3.0 port, which makes it a bit useless unless your laptop has USB-C ports. That screen got sent back to Amazon.

I then purchased the ASUS MB16AC, which advertised support for USB-C and USB 3.0. Plugged it in to both my Macbook Pro and my windows laptop with the Anker Powerline USB 3.0 to USB-C cable and it turned on instantly and works perfectly. I didn't use the included USB-C to USB 3.0 adapter due to other issues other users have experienced here with display flicker. The Anker cable worked perfectly the first time round.

-BUILD QUALITY-

The MB169C+ is a plasticky monitor with a black plastic front bezel that looks like a thin version of a regular desktop monitor. The back is plastic with I assume a faux-brushed metal cover to make it look more high-class. The included stand is badly designed with velcro and fabric tabs to prop the screen up. It doesn't inspire confidence that the screen won't fall over.

The MB16AC is built like a premium device. Brushed metal front with a really tiny bezel. The back is brushed metal and feels high quality. The included stand is a well-designed magnetic case that clicks into place reassuringly when you prop the monitor up on it.

Both are extremely light and thin. Perfect if you need a large screen available on-the-go.

-IMAGE QUALITY-

The MB169C+ has a full HD 1080P matte screen, which is good if you work outdoors or in areas with bright lights and glare.

The MB16AC has a full HD 1080P gloss screen, but is still visible outdoors quite well.

-VALUE FOR MONEY-

The MB169C+ might be cheaper than the MB16AC, but it feels less like a rugged portable monitor and more like a panel that's liable to break at any time. The MB16AC however feels like it's well built and will withstand being transported in a bag, rucksack or similar. Additionally, the MB16AC allows connectivity with older non-USB-C monitors with the inclusion of USB 3.0, which is extremely important if your laptop doesn't have any USB-C ports.

Out of both screens, I would highly recommend spending the extra money on the MB16AC. Don't waste your time with the MB169C+ unless you really like the look of it's front bezel or you only have USB-C computers and want to save a bit of cash.

If you want more information on the other models Asus offers, go to YouTube and watch reviews on them there. This is a good lineup of portable monitors, but they are all significantly different from each other.

UPDATE

3 months later and my MB16AC has proven to be an invaluable purchase. Still works perfectly. No dead pixels or connectivity issues. The included origami case has done a good job of protecting it in my rucksack. I'd highly recommend it.

Decided to purchase what looked like the newer model with an in-built battery (MB16AHP) to add another screen to my portable setup. That seems to only work on HDMI with my Macbook since the USB port is USB-C only (or if it is USB 3.0, it doesn't seem to like the latest Displaylink drivers). I'm debating returning the MB16AHP and purchasing another MB16AC because the MB16AC simply works whereas connecting the AHP model requires plugging it into HDMI and another USB source to maintain power when the inbuilt monitor battery dies.

If you have a USB-C machine and have no need for USB 3.0 support (or want HDMI), get the MB16AHP. If you need USB 3.0 support (and don't care about HDMI or an in-built battery), get the MB16AC

B0B31J9DM3,Gaffer,4.0,"Work fine as is on a USB-A 15"" MBP",15 March 2019,the United Kingdom,False,"Works really well with a nice clear image and easy to use. Text rendering is different though, it actually almost looks like it's rendering the text on screen as windows does so the text looks OK but appears less aliased than the native OS X Retina screen. This is probably due to the lower resolution and is a minor point as the screen is still perfectly useable as a replacement for your MBP screen (which is what I'm using it for --> I broke my MBP screen and rather than spend £400 to fix the 4.5yo MBP screen (£560 if from Apple), this screen at £230 is a good alternative until the new 16-16.5"" MBPs arrive this year and I upgrade).
I also should correct the other review that mentioned many freezes and bad lag until they bought an Anker cable. I also bought the Anker cable but needn't have as the cable+adapter the screen ships with works fine with no massive lag (apart from the tiny amount from the AirPlay protocol) and no freeze issues - running fine at full HD resolution so you actually don't need any extra cables.
It's worth adding that I am running a 15"" MBP with (broken) Retina display running High Sierra. It's also worth noting that rather than downloading the latest software from Asus' website, you can instead go to the official DisplayPort website and display the specific one for your OS X version (i.e. High Sierra has different drivers to Mojave).
If you are using USB-A to USB-C you NEED this software as what it is doing is ""tricking"" OS X into providing AirPlay data through the USB-A port....so the MBP is actually treating the ZenScreen as an AirPlay device but through a cable rather than WIFi.
If, on the other hand, you are using a newer TouchBar MBP with Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to USB-C direct then you don't need any additional software and it will work 'as is' out of the box and treat the ZenScreen as a separate screen not an AirPlay display. This means with newer MBPs you can fully turn off your existing screen and use the ZenScreen alone.
On top of this, if you're using an older MBP like me with USB-A, don't be tempted to buy the Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) adapter and connecting via that as that adapter will not transmit any displayport data so it won't work. In fact, only this AC model or the top AP model will work with a USB-A MBP (which is why I bought it - didn't need the battery power the AP version has so got the AC).
The rotation function also will not work with OS X but I don't need that functionality so don't mind.
Everything else works fine and the screen is thin and looks great and is bright enough for me. It is a bit heavy when being used with laptop on your lap but if being used as an extended screen is a great vfm alternative to a full monitor.
Highly recommended.

I'm currently using it to run Home Assistant and various other services, and it's been a fantastic addition to my setup.

Firstly, the packaging was excellent. The PC arrived in pristine condition, with no external damage, and was very well protected during transit. Upon unboxing, I found the unit to be clean and in great working order. I was also pleasantly surprised by how fast it operates, even when running multiple server applications. The HP ProDesk 400 G3 certainly outperformed my initial expectations in terms of speed and reliability.

One minor issue I encountered was that the PC didn’t come with a keyboard and mouse, despite the listing showing that these accessories were included. However, after reaching out to the seller, they promptly sent out the missing items, which arrived shortly afterward. I appreciated their quick response and resolution of the issue.

Overall, this is a great desktop PC that functions perfectly as a server for my needs. The performance, cleanliness, and speed all contribute to a very satisfying experience. Although the missing keyboard and mouse were a slight inconvenience, the seller’s prompt action made up for it. I would highly recommend this HP ProDesk 400 G3 for anyone looking for a reliable, compact desktop for general use or server purposes.

Keys somehow programme to stay pressed even when you've lifted up and the key isn't stuck down. Found forums that say other spectres across the board do this.

It's a stunningly, beautiful design. It has lovely rose gold edges and the on button is descrete to the left on a tiny edge. It has a modern geo edge look. The quality is lovely. It is quick to turn on and load up.

It's screen is crisp and bright.

Battery life on this version is very good. There was a more expensive Amoled screen version that drains battery power quicker which I didn't opt for as it halfed the battery life from what this version can do.

I bought it to do some gaming on with Steam but I know there are cheaper gaming laptops that have better capacity for quality gaming than this. It will run what I need such as State of Decay, Banished, House Flipper and non-competative Call of Duty. The Asus Tuf would have served a gamer better for cheaper money but Spectre definitely wins on looks and general feel. It definitely stands out to many other laptops because it is different and more elegant to look at than usual gaming chunky laptops.

The screen goes right to the edge and the quality of picture is lush.

The tablet screen is handy and the stylus is good. It feels so lovely to use.

You can't hear it is on. It is very silent, I haven't had the fans kick in yet.

It is a little heavier than I expected to pick up but not the heaviest. It just looks thin but definitely has a weight to it.

Cortana greets you on start up and has some good lines of dialogue.

You can log in with face recognition or thumb print.

I am a touch typist and my speed has dropped slightly because the large enter key has been replaced by a small one but this is a minor issue to retrain my brain to.

It is easy to use and set up.

It is a beautiful laptop that does what most people, unless extreme gamers, need a laptop to do.

1) As soon as I bought it, there was an instant price jump to £1200 for the same product from the same seller.
2) The charger was not in the plastic casing (the plastic was under the open charger).
3) The screen never turned on at all - there was an accessibility voiceover set up instead.

I contacted Amazon tech support but they were unable to help, and the manufacturer support was not available on weekends, so I decided to proceed with a return instead. I suspect they will try to resell this to someone else so be wary.

(NB: This review is about the specific laptop that I bought, and not a review about all HP Spectres in general - I will still buy another one, but from a physical store where I can just go in and get a replacement).

UPDATE 17/04/23
Amazon received the return on 30 March. I still haven't received my refund. I have been asked to wait until 24 April as there is a 30 day waiting period for returns of high value items (They were unable to provide a link to any policy stating this).

I have bought another HP Spectre which works beautifully so far! Love the extra height!

Second update:
Turns out the battery in the new one is fake. Also bought from Amazon from a different seller.

B08Q852QBG,Jim P,4.0,"Great laptop, however. . .",25 August 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"I purchased my first Spectre in 2016 which was as 13"" model. I wanted a larger screen so decided to go for this model. I spent a lot of time researching and almost went with the Dell XPS. I'm glad I chose the Spectre. Its superfast and doesn't get hot, except when it's doing a lot of updates - even on my lap it manages to stay only warm.

I knocked off one star because a screw was loose under one of the keys - this caused typing issues! I contacted HP Support and Amazon who offered to repair it, however I fixed it myself. Amazon did offer me a partial refund.

The one major gripe I have about this laptop is the keyboard backlight - after 30 seconds of inactivity on the keyboard/trackpad, it switches off even if the power supply is connected. Imagine working in a dark room and you want to resume typing! There is no way to configure the timeout. Great idea if you are working on battery supply, but not when the power is connected. Such a stupid design idea and it looks as though HP won't be providing an override feature anytime soon.

Pros:
- Keyboard and trackpad are a joy to use
- Excellent screen
- Windows Hello is A++
- Nice looking laptop
- Doesn't get too hot unless under heavy load
- Pen works well

Cons:
- Some bloatware that you might want to remove
- Prone to fingermarks, so make sure you keep it clean
- Keyboard backlight turn off after 30 seconds of inactivity on the keyboard/trackpad, even if the power supply is connected. No option to change this behaviour.

B08Q852QBG,Mr. D. M. Edney,5.0,"Superb laptop, great battery life despite 14"" OLED high res screen",14 September 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"Amazon inexplicably had these for £1095 for the Core i7 / 512GB SSD / 16GB / OLED model rather than the £1599 they normally list for so I bought it immediately. It would be a decent laptop for RRP but at that price it's amazing.

The screen is gorgeous, and while it does reduce battery life vs the LCD option it's still 8 hours or so. The machine is very responsive, leaving my much larger XPS15 with a 45W quad core 6th gen i7 in the dust, the keyboard is great, and you even get the pen and a nice folio case with it.

After years of Dell machines (private and work) with highly variable build and finish it is also very well put together. My only complaints are that the speakers are a bit quiet (but sound good), and some of the keys for slashes etc are a bit weird.",12

B0BSLVLS4P,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,8 July 2024,Mexico,False,"Bueno, esta es mi reseña despues de haber cumplido un año con ella , la verdad es que es muy buen equipo calidad precio, obviamente los primeros meses la bateria duraba bastante e inclusive corria juegos sin dar bajo de fps cuando se requeria demasiado procesamiento. Pero sinceramente corre juegos que yo nunca espere que correria y los correbastante bien, si se calienta un poco pero nada que los ventiladores que tiene no puedan arreglar.

Le hice unas pequeñas modificaciones como cambiarle la RAM y agregar otro disco SSD , la verdad es que en el disco segundario intento tener todos mis juegos y a pesar que algunos requieren casi o si estar en el disco principal, la comunicación de datos mediante el cablo que tiene es bastante buena (obviamente no le pidas demasiado, cumple su función y un poco más).

Actualmente ya la batería me da hora y media de carga, jugando o un poquito menos , trabajando o para entretenimiendo sin hacer uso de la tarjeta de video me dura entre 2 a 2 hrs y media sin problema alguno.

No le he dado mantenimiento y actualmente uno de sus ventiladores y hace un sonido bastante raro, pero considerando que si la he usado con usos forzados y sin mantenimiento considero que es normal, para que siempre esten al pendiente con sus equipos y realicen sus mantenimientos cada 6 meses.

En su momento me consto 16.6K, pero por lo que veo sigue siendo la mejor opción para juegos y productividad.

Considero que lo unico que cambiaria de fabrica seria el disco, por mas almacenamiento, pero de ahi en fuera, en estetica tiene casi de todo, el hecho de que puedas controlar mediante el NitroSenses las revoluciones de los ventiladores es una pasada. Consideren que tiene el teclado EU, osea no tiene ñ, pero con el tiempo te acostumbras, también puedes colocar ambas configuraciones de teclado y sin problema alguno.

B0BSLMQFXJ,Michael,5.0,Great 3K screen; Excellent performance; Laptop and Tablet in one device.,20 May 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"I bought this laptop for education instead of my gaming laptop which was much harder and posed with problem of transporting it in my bag. Samsung Book 3 Pro 360 is 2 in 1(laptop and tablet) and its weight is less then 2 kg. It is really light that makes my way to the college much easier. S Pen is giving you an ability to use your laptop as a notebook(undescribable emothions). After I bought this device I stopped use my tablet (Samsung galaxy Tab s7 Plus 5G) at all. Furthermore, about its performance I can say that its the fastest laptop I've ever seen (I am not include gaming performance on that). For programming, scrolling Internet, working it's a great choice.
But despite all of it, main disadvantages of Samsung Book 3 Pro 360 are 1) quite speakers(you need to place your laptop to close to you if you want to hear everything that happens in film) 2)Not as big capacity of battery as I expected (only four-six hours of working if you are in the Internet) but ,as a counterbalance, laptop has fast-charge.

B0BSLMQFXJ,Jamie R Perry,1.0,This laptop has single handedly made me leave Samsung ecosystem,26 June 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"I previously left a kinder 3 star review after 3 months of use, but 5 months later, I could not recommend this laptop to anyone and I think Samsung should be refunding all buyers.

Here is why:
Battery Life - Absolutely awful. I have gone through all the battery saving options and at best with minimal workload I get 3-4 hours. If video editing I am lucky to get 1 hour. I just arrived at a cafe without my charger and despite being on full battery, I know I will have to go back and get my charger after an hour of work...
Overheating - It heats up ridiculously quickly, not even if just doing intensive work.
Weak screen - The screen cracked in month 1 after commuting with it in my backpack. My friend with the same laptop also had a crack in his without any obviously damaging activity.
Doesn't sync with phone - I have all other Samsung devices, which I am strongly considering changing all over to Apple after this laptop. Quickshare never works between my laptop and phone, there are many issues here.
Crashes frequently - Many applications consistently crash on this laptop, not an issue I had on my previous Mac.

There are many more things I could say. I wish I could sell this back and wish I'd trusted my instincts and returned it within the first month when issues started to arise.

Samsung, I love your other products but wow, this is just awful. Despite contacting you directly about this and your false advertising on the specs, you have done nothing.

Do not buy!

B0BSLMQFXJ,Sinbad,3.0,Great laptop for artists however battery needed calibration,29 September 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"It's a bit dear for what it can do but what it can do (and do well) is leaps and bounds above the rest (if you're a windows user). The laptop can get a bit hot, however, I tent to use the less cpu/gpu intensive art programs which saves the lap. The one point of contention is that the battery was not calibrated on purchase. I fear this is the case with all new Samsung Book3 laptops and involves a full charge (it's not charge very much out of the box) which yields 98% full charge. This then has to be 'calibrated' in the bios with a full discharge (this puts up a horrible battery sign on the OLED screen you cannot turn off while the process is taking place), Once the laptop is fully discharged, I've been told that, once the laptop is again fully charged, you will get 100% out of the battery.
Two full charges before you can start using it properly is a bit out of order and Samsung should, with their seemingly infinitely larger resources, should at least calibrate the dam battery.",7

B0877C8V9G,CJA,5.0,"Superb, non-gaming ultrabook.....",2 November 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"The finish is described as natural silver aluminium, whilst being sandblasted and anodized in an all metal chassis. It really is stunning. Slightly heavier than expected which may be subliminal, expect a 1920x1080 full HD IPS screen, which is touch sensitive and a fingerprint magnet, but exceptionally bright at 1000 nits. Charging can reach 50% in thirty minutes, and advertised battery life of 10.25 hours is achievable, as long as you use the battery saving technology, limit brightness, and let go of bluetooth and location respectively. Sound quality is impressive, although not superb, as speaker placement might be questionned by some. The speakers are positioned under the left and right lower contours, either side of the trackpad, so airflow matters. You will need two hands to prise the screen open, as the hinge has been redesigned to a central affair which is relatively firm. At the time of writing, the hinge, which was something of an achilles heel in previous models, is holding strong (note since added below). The fingerprint sensor is fine also, and the quick release buttons for the camera and volume controls work really well. Connectivity comes in the form of a micro sd card reader, two USB type A connectors, a headphone socket and a thunderbolt C port. To be honest, it's a superb purchase, but compromises have been made. The camera quality is a little raw but still functional, and the graphics card/video memory rarely get you beyond first base. Although you will be able to play more dated games like Alan Wake, or the remastered Gears of War, as long as the titles aren't overly next gen and you tweak the settings as you need to. Two quick points which may be of interest: (a) there is a full temperature vent opposite the hinge, which will likely push hot air up the screen; and (b) HP have introduced software which almost allows for a silent fan, as long as you take the hit on processing power (screenshot attached for those looking for the HP Command Center, which is where you apply the necessary tweaks). I did have a few issues initially with the cursor repositioning itself whilst typing, although that appears to be a Windows 10/trackpad fault, so go through the bespoke settings as carefully as you can when setting up, and you'll get there. For those wanting to upgrade their hardware following the transition to home working, this is heavily recommended but do consider the different models carefully. I picked up the entry level version for £850.00 across five instalments, but one or two may need the additional horsepower so do your homework (said politely). And I've included a screenprint for HP's proprietry software, which makes finding information about your warranty, updating your bios, and optimising everything something of a breeze. Don't expect perfection, but you will probably be a little bit proud of what you've purchased, unless you change your ultrabooks on the fly and don't tolerate compromise in any context. I think they achieved a sensible balance, personally, and Wifi reach is the strongest I've had on any device, period.......

Note 1 - the left hinge failed after 4.5 months, but the manufacturer has agreed a warranty repair with courier collection and return, although I may use it as a desktop replacement going forward as it's still a great PC (the hinges on each side are likely screwed vertically into a plastic base, which may not be strong enough to support the weight/torque involved - presumably there's a reason they didn't adopt metal foundations, and just bury the issue permanently?

Note 2 - if the fan is a concern for you, press F12 to gain fast access to the differing thermal profiles, and choose the last option which renders the fan minimal, barely audible and generally silent.

B0877C8V9G,LoveReading,4.0,Nice laptop!,7 July 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"I've been using this for about 4 weeks. First impression: it's lightweight, nice design, slim, easy to set up, keyboard feels comfortable, touchscreen seems good, it works easily with all my usual software, both mainstream (e.g. Word, Excel, etc) and some specialist programs I need to use for work. It was very easy to move everything over to the new laptop and continue with work projects I'd started.

My only small criticisms so far:

It says in the description that it has multi SD card slots. It actually has a micro SD slot. Thats a minor issue, but if you need anything else, you'll have to buy an SD card reader with a USB plug.

My previous laptop had a black keyboard with white lettering, which was very easy to see. I am a reasonably good typist, so don't normally look at the keys, but on this one the lettering is much harder to see, especially if the light is shining on the keyboard, so if you're not a touch typist, you might not get on well with this keyboard.

The battery life isn't too good - around 5-6 hours. Again, not really an issue for me as I use it at home so can easily plug in when needed, but perhaps a problem if you're planning to use it out and about.

Other than that, I'm happy so far.

Do I plan to use it with an HdMi to micro HDMI - yep! So no issues with adding a monitor. Do I use a external keyboard and mouse/ sure do. So no issues with the mousepad. Do I have a power station so I can add more monitors or other peripheral devices- of course so do. To the people who say it’s slow and it only has 4 ports and one is a micro/ or it has less ram than they need. It’s under $200 and mine is purple …additionally to the WiFi complaints I had that issue and when I upgraded my WiFi to the highest 1000 + / or whatever is the highest for your area— I stopped having dis connectivity issues with my last laptop. You also may need a new modem- the old ones worked with like 10 devices - so this new laptop may be putting you over the limit. Update your device and it will work. So it is wonderful for me. Did I mention is was under $200?,0
B0CV62HBRG,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,15 February 2025,the United States,False,"Works fine enough (when it works).

There are some serious connectivity issues when it comes to this device and wifi. Without fail, after every 30 or so minutes, it disconnects from wifi and claims no wifi is available. The only way to rectify it is to restart the computer (which takes 5+ minutes, start to finish).

Every other device in my household AND my internet router (and provider) disagree....the wifi exists and there is no reason for the disparity beyond an issue with the device itself.

Other than that, the slow and laggy processing speed, the over-reactive mousepad (had to turn it off and only use a wireless mouse), off-sized USB ports (good luck getting anything in or out of those), lack of a standard HDMI or USB C (only has a micro) port, and questionable battery life....it is fine enough.

I purchased it primarily for writing, so it serves it's purpose in that respect. If I was using it for literally anything else......this review would likely be far harsher.

Update: one day after writing my initial review, Chrome, Firefox, and Edge ceased working entirely. No fixes offered by the Windows troubleshooting program, no indication of what is wrong.....my internet is working perfectly.

Without connectivity, this device is now absolutely useless to me.

However the main selling point here is it's touchscreen and stylus. It feels really good and very close to writing on paper. As long as you have the right software (onenote, or equivalent) you can take notes and even search back handwritten notes without any problem (This is a feature of one note, not the laptop, but you still need a stylus enabled touchscreen laptop to make use of the feature).

In build quality also feels really good, and like it will last a long time (I've only owned it for a month, so hard to comment on longevity).

The mains things to keep in mind though are that the RAM on this (and most 2 in 1s are soldered on, so you cannot upgrade it once you have purchased it. This has 8GB so should be fine for a while, but dont buy anything lower than that.",3

B08QZFB5F1,Mr. R. Blomley,5.0,"Overall, a really nice machine.",13 June 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"After my ridiculously expensive Aorus gaming laptop failed after only 2 years, I decided to replace it with something far lighter and more practical.
I was immediately impressed by the feel of this Asus zenbook and, having used MacBooks for over a decade, would compare it to the most recent Air models... but is more practical, having a USB3.0 port and hdmi.
The screen is very nice and the keyboard types well...the only negative I can state is that the 'enter' key is not the most right-sided key - there's a PgDn key to it's right which I keep pressing when not fully concentrating.
As with all laptops, the battery life is going to be relative to the operation of the device - it's not been an issue for me personally, I simply plug it in when I'm doing something resource heavy.
Finally, my wife has stated, as a fully paid up Apple aficionado, that ""considering it's a Windows machine, my laptop's not too bad"" - that should be considered high praise and recommendation!!",0
B08QZFB5F1,TomDickHarri,5.0,Poor display? Microsoft's fault (of course!) Cue AMD,25 July 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"I noticed a complaint about the dull display as I also observed the same thing initially. Looked at the driver; yup, courtesy of M/S (groan). Went to the AMD website and downloaded the tool to autodetect and install the required driver: display now vibrant.
I didn't buy the laptop for myself but I keep it updated and recently a firmware update was foisted on me. ""I'm perfectly happy with it as it is, go away!"" Couldn't stop or circumvent it, nor could I see how to move it on until I realised the answer was off-screen (Display too big for small screen & no scroll bars. Naughty programmer! ).
Ah well I thought, perhaps it'll straighten out the battery problem which shows three hours available one minute, one hour the next, then suddenly six hours appear, in other words you never know whether you're coming or going, going, go.....
The firmware update ended OK and didn't fix the lying battery information but clobbered the AMD display software. Display looked OK but kept getting pop-up message that driver and software were out of sync. Had to run the tool again to get a new driver/software package from AMD.
Just need more accurate battery readings now.
Otherwise the machine is quick and charges quickly, looks good and feels solid and unlike our 'ZenBook Flip' the trackpad isn't afflicted with 'Saint Vitus Dance'.
Thanks to Bluetooth (or adapters), the headphone socket needn't be missed. If you want to feed in a disc (or several) there are small, lightweight external optical drives available. Bought cheap one from Amazon over two years ago and finding it invaluable.

The battery life has never exceeded 2.5 hours, even on the most power-saving option. I recently bought a new battery, just in case that has always been the problem, given Asus' boast about 22 hours battery life. No - same behaviour.
Everything else about the laptop is very good for my purposes, especially decent ram, decent disk space, good build, comfortable keyboard.
But reasonable battery life is the number one expectation in a laptop. If it can't manage that, well, it deserves no more than 2 stars, in my book.
Looking at another poster's comments, I'm not sure returning it for repair would have made any difference, as the replacement battery suggests there is a fundamental issue with the design.

It does not come with either a usb to headphone adapter or a usb to network adapter.
There was not much bloat ware, I did quickly delete the McAffee AV as this was giving false warnings and tried to stop installation of Thunderbird.
The bios needed to be updated and it was not obvious, but happened in the end after rebooting several times.
Seems a good machine but ASUS are annoying as they make so many similar models and you can’t find the specs of them.
Another slightly annoying think is that the enter/return key is small. The shift key much bigger. Otherwise the keyboard has a good feel.

B08CHMYNXK,Jonathan Reynolds,4.0,Exceptional APU for the money. Build quality is also great.,10 September 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"Having spent the last year or so toiling away with a super entry level laptop this unit is a breath of fresh air. Most of my heavy usage like gaming or media creation is done on my desktop PC so I wasn't in need of a high powered laptop but even with that considered I'd recommend buying something like this laptop over a super cheap one.

This is a proper PC compared to chromebooks etc especially once you've upgraded it a bit which is super cheap and easy. It's powered by an Athlon Gold 3150u which is a dual core CPU with 4 threads so for all intents and purposes it will perform like a quad core chip with only slightly less performance. For casual browsing and even fairly intensive workloads it will breeze through it. Obviously don't expect to be doing render projects on it etc but It'll deal with most productivity workloads you throw at it like spreadsheets etc.

Fun fact, the current Athlon range use the same strong CPU cores as found in the Ryzen chips. They're just a different entry level range.

The unit comes equipped with 4gbs of RAM which is fine to begin with however I'd highly recommend buying an extra stick of 2400mhz sodim RAM and sticking it in to up the capacity and make the memory work in dual channel which allows the GPU to work with a lot more memory bandwith. The max capacity the laptop can handle is 12gb so sticking an extra 8gb stick in is a good shout and only costs about £26.

Speaking of which did you know this thing can game? Yep it most certainly can thanks to the onboard Vega 3 graphics. Now don't expect to be playing all modern games and definitely not at 1080p but the list of games I have been able to run so far includes Resident Evil 2 remake at 720p 60% resolution scale, Destiny 2 same res, Dragon Age Inquisition 720p, The Witcher 3 720p low settings.

Those aren't exactly light weight games and with a little tweaking of the settings you can get them running at 30fps and they look absolutely fine on the smaller screen. You can even take advantage of AMD radeon's adrenaline drivers which gives you access to a slew of graphical effects to improve image quality further.

For a £299 laptop with a few upgrades on top like extra ram and a larger hard drive you'll have a device that performs like a proper PC and can play some very recently released games. This is why AMD's mobile offerings appeal to me much more than Intel's current crop. The integrated graphics performance is on another level.

A highly recommeded device.

Screen definition and clarity are perfect for a laptop sized display. Only drawback is the delay in response with some apps which is most likely a performance bottleneck due to the low installed RAM. It's worth paying the extra £30 for an 8GB stick of DDR4-2666MHz RAM and fitting it yourself to save the extra £150 for the next level up of this model, although that one does come with a Core I3 processor which would be significantly faster.

I run a business from it and also use it for gaming and have had no issues with performance. There is a minor issue with the touchpad clicking/rattling as mentioned in another review, but at the price point I got it at (mid twelves) it wasn’t worth returning and paying more to get one at a higher price. The charger is enormous and heavy so that’s worth considering.

B091TWSHHJ,Amp...,1.0,Briliantly executed hardware design marred by an inability to deliver the fundementals,31 May 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"The design of this notebook has to be seen to really understand the efforts Samsung has made to shrink a 15.6"" laptop to the size of a 13"" one. The Screen (which wobbles if its not on a table)is stupendous as is the touchpad. They even managed to squeeze in a separate numerical keypad. In my time with the notebook I managed to use it for 8+ hours without needing a charge. The hardware is as good as the best out there as its made of aluminium. As a Samsung stalwart and user for many years there was only 1 reason I was looking forward to this expensive notebook and that was to complete my ecosystem- Phone, watch, smartags, pay card etc. I only needed the quickshare function and Notes sync. Neither worked with the Galaxy Bookpro 360.
Firstly, quickshare would not find my oneUI 2.5 enabled Note 9 despite numerous calls to Samsungs tech support in India and the UK. Nobody at Samsung knew why it would not function as promised. The disappointment worked in either direction- phone to PC or PC to phone.
Secondly, Notes sync would not sync despite multiple 2 stage authentications with my Samsung account.
Thirdly, the camera is probably the worst I've come across in either a mobile or notebook in over 10 years. Its so grainy regardless of light. In fact I'd say its performance is more like 320P, its absolutely atrocious.
There are loads of reviews on line about these computers to see what they can do but for me as a Galaxy smartphone user the fundamentals are lacking. I researched it well before firing the pre-order which Samsung UK messed up BADLY. In the end I purchased of Amazon for less stress and frustration.
When you look beyond the hype this is not really worth the asking price. For the same money you get 1TB of memory in the US. Tech support is appalling, I've spent close to 2 days trying to get this notebook to produce what was promised. The setup is not for the faint hearted, so many levels of security to agree to and many sub menus to get simple things to work. The warranty is only 12 months and based on what I've experienced only the Windows element of the notebook will be working OK in 12 months.
If you're a Galaxy smartphone user this is NOT Samsungs Apple moment. If you want ease of use and setup and a flawless eco system buy Apple/IOS.
I'm a Windows and Galaxy Android user but would never recommend the Galaxy Book Pro 360.

IT’s been a year and a month and the screen goes on something that costs this much, I am absolutely disgusted and will now be looking into getting my money back as this item can now not be used, everything I had on there I can not get off that includes personal photos that I now no longer have, the thing is going in the bin as I don’t feel I should be paying anything to get it fixed.

B07P9233QJ,Mr J Fairclough,3.0,Potentially great little laptop ruined by dodgy touchpad and weak battery life,28 February 2020,the United Kingdom,False,This is a good little laptop with decent processing speed and a good keyboard that is lovely to type with. I don't know how on earth 7 hours can be achieved with the battery life; 4 hours is much more realistic. My main issue is the touchpad - I have had to update the driver several times and it still has moments of unreliability. A simple task such as cutting and pasting text can seem beyond it as it freezes up as if pondering whether that really is the section you mean to highlight. I guess you get what you pay for but it does seem a shame that a laptop that ticks some big boxes in terms of speed and memory but can be let down on some of the basics.,5

Other than that, the condition of the casing is first class, ex-works, and can't be faulted.
However, battery life was poor from the outset and is now down to less than four hours of normal surfing and typing, never streaming unless an odd Youtube counts. More worryingly it crashes at random with Windows issues far too many times for my liking and sometimes has taken twenty minutes to come back to life and restart. Each time I'm half expecting a black screen and a message saying Windows has failed. I would not buy another laptop from here again, Microsoft registered or not.
To be absolutely fair I've not contacted the seller about this, mainly as not only am I severely disabled I have been isolating since March and getting to a Post Office to return it, which would normally be very difficult for me anyway, is still impossible.",5

B0999MGFT3,Rob Sedgwick,5.0,Great all-round device,20 June 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"I was very impressed with this Lenovo Yoga 7. It's the first device exactly like this that I have used, so I can't compare it to more expensive competitors other than to say I don't feel like I need to pay more.

First of all, it's a good laptop. It's touchscreen, came with Windows 10, but I upgraded to 11 straight away which was pretty seamless and everything worked fine under the new OS.

You can flip the lid around into a tent shape which is good for reading books ok or watching a film. Or you can flatten it and the keyboard goes on the bottom and it turns into a tablet. The keyboard ceases to work in this mode. It's a bit heavier than a standard tablet but the good thing is it's Windows and it's the same device you use for everything else so no need to worry about syncing and saving everything.

I found it very natural to use it as a laptop when in that mode. I naturally don't touch the screen much as I am used to using a keyboard and mouse, for that reason touchscreen laptops are wasted on me. But when it's a tablet then I forget about that mouse and keyboard

I can also plug it into my docking station in my home office and use a full-size keyboard, proper mouse and large monitors. If I was starting afresh or was on a budget I really would consider just having this and a phone, and forgo tablets and desktops entirely, as these multi-purpose devices are now fit for purpose and competitively priced to seriously consider using for your everyday needs.

They will run but with poor frame rates and some stutters at times as well. The only good things about this laptop are the 144Hz display and the design. I only bought it a few months ago and really regret wasting my money on such a poor product.",2

B088HW65G9,Phill6815,3.0,Not worth the money,23 October 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"I bought this laptop after owning a 5-year-old HP spectre 360. thinking that the new-gen processor and bigger RAM would give me a faster experience, oh how wrong was I. Even the most basic photo processing is SLOW, and the fan is loud and kicks in straight away. There is nothing that this does that is remotely worth the money paid, it performs like a mid-range laptop. The B&O sound is pointless, it is quiet and in no way is any louder/clearer than any other laptop I have owned.
On the plus, it is solid and well made. The fingerprint reader is a good addition and performs well. The keyboard layout is good and the keypress feels OK.
All in, this performs like a mid-range laptop, not a mid-top that the price/specs would suggest...an I7 that struggles with basic tasks, not good.",3
B088HW65G9,Zaoui Melanie,1.0,Like other buyers mentioned earlier... It's a HUGE FLOP! Returned for a REFUND.,20 January 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"I had high expectations from this laptop but it turned out to be the biggest flop that it is.
I bought it as my new powerful workstation. It performed flawlessly for 3 weeks, as one would expect of such a machine, but after that time it showed signs of weakness... glitches started to appear, lagging, various crucial softwares started to crash one after another and it just wasn't the same machine.
3 weeks !!!! Finally, the operating system crashed completely and could not perform at all. Pics attached. The unit was officially unusable. Complete waste of my time :(((( Wasted a whole working day on this POS laptop.

**Kudos to Microsoft and HP support for being so professional in trying to solve the problem. They gave up and suggested returning the unit.

Pros -
Fast (while it was still alive)
The keyboard is a bliss
The touchpad is great
The touch screen works great
Very slick metal built and professional look
Low price

Cons -
VERY Heavy laptop
VERY heavy charger
Fans are noisy when operating
Glossy Screen with reflection
Might crash and DIE from the get-go

Returned back to AMAZON UK for a REFUND.

Conclusion:
STAY AWAY FROM SHINY OBJECTS.
STICK TO THE RIVERS AND LAKES THAT YOU'RE USED TO...

B088HW65G9,Robotron 2084,1.0,Poor quality control. 3 out of 3 were faulty straight out of the box.,15 September 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"I recently purchased the 13.3"" version of this laptop, and two 15.6"" models - all had faults straight out of the box.

Thankfully, Amazon's customer service is second to none, and I have been able to return all 3 for a refund.

HP Envy 13-ba0010na 13.3-Inch (price at time of purchase £1049.99):

This was returned because the backlight on the 'S' key did not function correctly (the attached photo doesn't really capture just how dim the key was compared to all the others). While this may seem like a minor issue, this was a brand new laptop with a RRP of around £1150. It shouldn't have passed quality control.

It's worth noting that the 13.3"" display has a VERY narrow viewing angle. This is due to HP's 'Sure View' privacy screen, which is essentially passive and therefore is 'on' all the time - pressing the button to 'activate' it merely dims the screen a little. Not really a problem for me, but worth a mention for anyone considering this model, especially if you intend to use it to watch movies, etc. with more than one person. The 15.6"" has a much better display and wide viewing angle. However...

HP Envy 15-ep0011na 15.6-inch (price at time of purchase £1499.99):

The first one I bought had distorted audio coming out of the right speaker. This was apparent the moment it was switched on for the first time - Cortana's voice was crackling (even at medium volume). Once the initial Windows setup was complete, I checked the audio output at various levels, checked the drivers were up to date, the audio settings, headphone output, etc., and this confirmed that the right speaker was indeed faulty.

Another 'quirk' I noticed was that the backlight on the 'R' key was twice as bright as all the other keys on the keyboard.

Additionally, the laptop had a problem with USB 3.0 devices - namely that it wouldn't recognise them unless used with a USB 2.0 cable, which completely defeats the object. As I intended to return this immediately for a replacement, I didn't spend much time looking into this - and thought it may just be a configuration issue. However...

The replacement 15.6"" laptop arrived a couple of days later and exhibited the same USB issue - no recognition of USB 3.0 devices unless connected with a USB 2.0 cable, and VERY SLOW transfer speed via both USB 'A' ports.

After much Googling, checking the drivers, switching the adaptors off an on again, and so on, I contacted HP support who talked me through several things including resetting the BIOS and (finally) running a hardware test on the USB ports. The conclusion from this was that (surprise!) the ports were faulty. Either I was incredibly unlucky to get two 15.6"" laptops with exactly the same hardware fault, or this is an issue with this particular model (the USB ports on the 13.3"" model worked perfectly, and data transfer speeds were 10 times faster than on the 15.6"") .

Finally, in addition to my USB woes, the touchpad on this last one was a little loose and 'clicked' when you lifted your finger off it - no matter how little pressure you put on it. Minor, but quite annoying for a £1500 device. Oh, and did I mention that the left speaker (while not as bad as the right one on the previous purchase) also had some distortion when playing audio?

You may get lucky and find that everything works as it should, but after 3 out of 3 having faults, I'm not prepared to try a 4th time.

Needless to say, I will be buying laptops from manufacturers other than HP from now on.

B0877L4RPX,RL,5.0,"Lighteeight, very usable, just works",12 January 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"Love this device. Runs Linux a treat, it's fast and the only feature which doesn't work under Linux is the fingerprint reader. But I don't use that anyway.

Everything else just works.

I don't often rate spending over £1,000 as good. But this machine is so worth it.

Bang & Oulfson audio is more than adequate, it's not a PA system but loud enough and crystal clear for a laptop.

WiFi is powerful enough and doesn't drop.

Screen is sharp and clear with high resolution.

Very lightweight and easy to flip the screen from laptop to tablet mode.

Battery lasts for ages and no matter what I do doesn't seem to negatively affect it, streaming 4K media I watched a complete film and it still had tons of charge left.
The only downsides, which are livable, is there is nowhere to store the pen. I would have thought a small slot in the body was not that difficult to accommodate.

The / key is kind of difficult to get too, using Linux, web browser this is a must.

The screen can have some glare if you have direct strong light behind you.

Other than this, absolutely awesome kit.

B08H6SCT6Q,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,10 February 2021,the United States,False,"I got my Flip S 1-2 weeks ago (4K OLED Touch | i7-1165G7 | 1TB). So far, it has been as expected. This replaced a 4-year old, lower-end ASUS that I was generally happy with (ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 13.3-inch | Core i5 Processor, 8GB DDR3, 256GB SSD) but started to have battery issues and was under-powered at this point.

Pros:
- The screen is awesome.
- Overall build quality seems good. Very stable screen when I'm using on my lap.
- I like the keyboard--both the travel of the keys/feel of the keys and also the layout. My prior ASUS had the same size keyboard (but with a buffer on the sides instead of the home/pgUp/pgDn/end on the right), so I was used to it. I like the layout of having those home/pgUp/pgDn/end keys on the right.
- And I like that the power button is no longer at the top right on the keyboard. (That drove me nuts on my prior ASUS.)
- Touchpad. The touchpad is a massive upgrade. And I find that I use the number pad feature more than I thought I would.

Complaints from other reviews (here and elsewhere) that don't bother me:
- Shiny screen. This is true and means you have to raise the brightness to compensate. This impacts battery life, but that doesn't effect me much as (i) I am usually able to plug in, (ii) when I'm not, I am usually on a <4 hour flight, and (iii) I carry a massive backup battery.
- Wobble when in tablet mode. I noticed this the first time I used it. I haven't noticed it since. Not a big deal.
- Fingerprint magnet. True, but not as bad as others have said and I don't really care anyway.
- No headphone jack. This doesn't bother me, as my Android had USB-C so all my headphones have the adapter on already.
- Power button on the side. I haven't accidentally hit it yet. Sometimes I think I've pressed it and haven't, so have to press a little harder, but that seems like a feature (against accidental pressing)
- Fan noise. Hasn't been a big issue, but I haven't pushed it that hard.

Cons:
- Would be nice to have a fingerprint reader

Other:
- As is often the case, I had to run a ton of Windows updates when it arrived. There was some strange behavior before, but it all went away after the updates.
- Performance: TBD. I haven't done any video editing, etc.

Performance with Windows 7 and 10 isn't earth shattering, but possibly down to bottleneck on harddrive access. It's a Toshiba unit, I'd be happy if it needs replacing.
Plenty of ports, especially usb. dvd drive was something I wanted but makes the machine thick. Again ok with that. Keyboard screen fine. up/down arrow keys annoying.

Audio output is a bit on the low side.

B09SHVYQZR,Andrei Andrieș,5.0,Impressive performance,21 August 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"EDIT: I dropped it from waist level. Everything still works, but the display hinges are dead. Spare parts are hard to find and not really cheap (around 200-250 pounds to replace back cover and display - in case it breaks during removal)

I bought this laptop on the 1st Prime Day for 1.000 pounds - I got a bit disappointed to find out the next day was 850 pounds, but nonetheless, it offered me a high performance machine in this price range.

After a bit over one month of using this laptop, here are the pros and cons I've noticed about the MSI Delta 15 (16GBs RAM, 1TB SSD, R9-5900, 240 hz):

Pro:
- The laptop can run virtually any game on at least medium-high quality (1080p) whilst having decent fps (can easily handle gaming + screen recording/streaming - also tried this while on battery, all worked perfectly fine).

- The 240hz display is very smooth and definitely is an advantage in competitive games (this display can be overclocked to 265hz using CRU)

- Windows boots up in 7 seconds and is highly responsive.

- Battery can be capped at 60% via MSI Center (to keep the battery in shape in the long run)

- The laptop has a DisplayPort USB-C port. The absence of this would've been a deal breaker for me since I can switch from work (also with DisplayPort) to personal laptops without switching the connected USBs into the monitor.

- Wi-Fi speeds can go up to 90/100 Mbps upload/download, 3ms ping (Romania), but can definitely go higher with a beefier internet router.

- This beast's looks are simple and almost professional looking. The laptop does not scream ""I'm a gamer"" which would've been another deal-breaker for me. The only give-aways are the logo on the back of the display and the big vents - as long as you don't enable rainbow keyboard lights, you can lay low in public and do your work.

- Lightweight. Less than 2kg is decent for the performance this laptop outputs.

- The processor is really efficient and that translates to great battery life for usual tasks;

- The audio quality of the speakers is pretty good. Decent bass, balanced (also check cons)

- The fans are very quiet while doing usual tasks (there is also a ""silent"" fan speed)

- Cooler Boost can significantly reduce the running temperature and you may not be needed to buy a separate laptop cooler (also check cons).

CONS:
- The keyboard is unresponsive in the first 4-5 seconds after complete boot-up (doesn't apply for sleep boot-up). Maybe someone else found a fix for this issue.

- The display is a bit wobbly - unnoticeable when using the keyboard though.

- The temperature reaches the 95 Celsius peak pretty quick;y while playing games on max settings + uncapped FPS

- The fans are noisy while running intensive processes (games, various exports - audio, video). While using Cooler Boost fan speed you will most definitely require using headphones.

- The speakers' volumes are pretty low. The output audio can be post-processed using Nahimic, but you will lose the intended original quality and realism of music/movies/games audio.

- My file organising skills are pathetic, so the 1TB SSD easily runs out of space. Wouldn't have been a problem if the laptop could've been upgraded with a good ol' chunky HDD, but unfortunately, there is an extra SSD (PCIe) slot available, not SATA. The higher capacity SSDs can get really expensive compared with HDDs.

The reason I gave this laptop a five-star rating is because it is maybe the best machine I could've bought at the 1.000-pound mark that had most to all features I was looking for (and above).

The screen is a 1080p IPS panel running at a blistering 240hz, but increased resolutions are possible if you output to an external monitor or TV.

Certain compromises have been made on the way, such as the SSD being Gen 3, lack of ethernet port, no USB charging (to name but a few) but that doesn't take away from how good this laptop is. It might sound like a jet engine taking off during load - the MSI Center app defaults the fan speed to ""extreme performance"" for some reason, so either invest in some decent headphones, or reduce the fan setting to ""balanced"".

I encourage you to watch the various reviews on YouTube for this product - just search for ""MSI Delta 15"" - bear in mind that all the videos were made pre-FSR. This laptop will run games even better, now that FSR 1.0/2.0 is commonplace these days.",0

However, I have this annoying backlight bleed bottom left corner and the right speaker straight up does not work. Re-installed audio drivers and reseted multiple times, but no use. I generally use headphones when consuming content, so not a huge issue. the left hinge flexes a lot and there is an obvious gap in it that makes me concerned on the long run, but the right hinge looks more compact and sturdy. I'm honestly hesitant whether to return it or keep it. Still testing for more flaws to make a decision.",2

This is why I only buy acer products
After about 6 months of using this product, i will improve my review:
Everything in this product is still working very, very well and I am still very satisfied with my purchase.
However, one concern for gamers is the ram, if you plan on using this laptop for more intensive tasks, consider buying more ram to go alongside it. It will save you so much trouble in all honesty.",0
B08VKNVDDR,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,15 September 2021,the United States,False,"Fast and simple setup, wifi connection strong and fast. Not overloading with shovelware, has a decent variety of utilities and software, most of which looks reasonable for the typical pc user.
Havent tested for gaming, and don't plan to on anything modern/4k, mostly emulation which shouldn't burden it too much. Intergrated graphics has enough power to run background apps for any upscaled emulation to 1080p, but I wouldnt try and run anything like twitch simultaneously. I plan on using it lightly, some work, some low key gaming, and for the price it makes sense. A great laptop for students, its a good size with enough umph for your educational needs, or if you're bored.
Design is great, feels very solid, keyboard is great, fingerprint sensor actually works (i do construction and my hands get wrecked all the time, this a big deal for me).
Sync'd with my phone super easy in under 5 minutes, porting my google account and contacts no problem!
I'd highly recommend for someone that wants a great machine for an awesome price. I'm not saying it has all the power in the world, or storage, or biggest battery, but for the price you'll be greatly impressed with how the specs shine on this laptop. Also impressively thin, and hasn't really gotten above a warm temp. Solid state usually helps greatly with this, as all laptops use these now.
Overall I highly recommend, and this would also be the perfect backup laptop for travel or to carry daily and not worry about something happening to it and cost you a grand. Mac users could find this as a viable pc option to meet their non-Mac needs.

B08VKNVDDR,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,1 October 2021,Mexico,False,"Excelente laptop A515-46-R14K ,,,, no es una laptop de juegos, pero por el precio, y algunas mejoras {upgrade} puede quedar como una verdadera Premium el detalle es que hay que saber lo que se hace.
El teclado iluminado, y el sensor de huella, son caracteristicas de laptops de mayor costo, y ese fue uno de los motivos de compra. La calidad es magnifica, es una portatil bella en su apariencia, y comoda en su manejo. A la fecha, ya le aumente la memoria a 8 gb. con un modulo DDR4 Hynix de 4 gb. de 3200 mhz. para activar el dual channel, y trabaja a la perfeccion. La memoria que trae esta portatil Acer, es de 4 gb. a 3200 mhz., y no de 2400 mhz. como muchos dicen. esto, puede saberse, entrando en Windows, a Simbolo de sistema, y escribiendo el siguiente comando >>>>>> wmic memorychip get speed, banklabel, manufacturer, memorytype <<<<< que en mi caso resulto una memoria DDR4 (0 significa ddr4) de 3200 mhz de velocidad, y el fabricante es Micron Technology, y es por eso que le añadí, el modulo descrito arriba. La persona que quiera aumentar la memoria a esta portatil, puede usar el comando de arriba y conocer la velocidad y el fabricante de su memoria, y asi, escoger un modulo de la misma velocidad para el aumento de su memoria,,,,no entren a Windows>Administrador de tareas>Rendimiento, pues ahi, les mostrara 2400 mhz de velocidad,,,,usen el comando de arriba para saber la verdadera velocidad, el fabricante, y el tipo de memoria que debe ser ddr4. Ademas de aumentar la memoria, ya le adapte un SSD Crucial MX500 de un terabyte, e incluso cambie el NVMe de 128 gb. por un Kingston KC2500 NVMe de 500 gb. previa clonacion del de 128 gb. original que trae el sistema operativo Windows 10 Home.
Esta computadora ahora, es RAPIDISIMA, con una buena capacidad de almacenamiento, y trabajando en DUAL CHANNEL. Si alguien desea actualizar esta Acer, le RECOMIENDO, aprender como se hace fisicamente, desde abrir la computadora SIN DAÑARLA, y OJO, DESCONECTAR LA BATERIA, antes de hacer algun cambio en el hardware. Resumiendo,,,,SI se puede aumentar la memoria,,,,,SI se puede ponerle un SSD,,,,,y SI se puede incluso, cambiar el modulo NVMe de 128 gb. pero, HAY QUE SABER COMO.
Esta maquina es excelente por su precio, y trabaja de maravilla. Espero les sirva esta redaccion.

It did not come in its original packaging, but it was in perfect condition. I could not see a single mark or even a finger smudge on the case, screen, or keyboard. It came with the power supply and a kit to mount a 2.5” SATA drive. Plus, a keyring lanyard swag thing shown in the first photo. The price for this Used – Very Good computer was substantially less than a new computer. OK, how ‘bout the computer itself?

Pro:
3 memory slots: two PCIe M.2 slots, plus a 2.5"" bay
Pretty fast i7-11800H CPU
Comes with a kinda slow RTX 3050 Ti GPU, but a least it has one
Two fans and lots of vents for good cooling
Backlit keyboard
Separate number pad
Three USB-A 3.2 and one USB-C 3.2 Thunderbolt ports
An RJ-45 Ethernet port
No bloatware

Neutral:
Keyboard requires more key pressure than others I’ve used
512 GB installed SSD is not very big
Installed SSD is not the fastest

Con:
8 gig is not really enough RAM for most users
No cardreader slot

Trade-offs:
Battery capacity vs 2.5” memory slot

Things that are good but I don’t care about:
144 Hz display refresh rate
Display color fidelity
Graphics performance in general
Alexa built-in

I am a recording engineer, so I use this laptop as a DAW which I use to mix my audio recordings. I also do a little bit of video production too, but as little as possible. So what I am looking for in a laptop is lots of storage memory and a fast CPU. With a few additions, this laptop fits my requirements.
As is shown in the photo, there are 3 memory slots. Memory 1 is what came with the laptop. It’s a middle of the road 512 GB WD PC SN530 which holds the OS. Not the fastest SSD around, and a candidate for improved performance by moving the OS to a faster and probably larger SSD. I installed Memory 1 & 2. Memory 2 is a 2TB SSD. Memory 3 is a 2TB HDD. Yes, the HDD is old school, but I own it already and it contains a lot of files that I’d have to clone to a new SSD. So installed memory is 4.5TB, which is enough to keep me recording for a couple of years.
This computer came with one slot of 8 gig RAM, which is not enough for most applications. But RAM is inexpensive, so I added 8 gig more which is plenty for me.
Battery life is not good, maybe 2 hours if you’re lucky. But the battery life is a trade-off for the 2.5” memory slot, because it takes up space that could be used for a bigger battery, as you can see in the photo. Almost all the time I run off of AC, so I’d rather have the 2.5” slot than a bigger battery.
When used as a DAW, I don’t care much about the graphics capability of this laptop. When doing the occasional video production, it is nice to have the GPU.
Yes, I’d buy one again. In fact, this is my second Nitro 5, my other is a Nitro 5 17-inch.

Who had this great idea of putting it only on the right side so the cable impedes any mouse attached? Why can't be one on each side? Also when disabling the fn key reverse (which is enabled by default and driving me nuts) in the bios the fn lock Led stays on all the time. What's the point? I had to cover it with electrical tape so it won't bother me. The brightness control keys didn't work out of the box, I had to install a driver from HP website. The webcam, well it is cheap and low quality. In low light conditions when using warm tone lightbulbs the white balance is so off the I looked more orange than a certain president. I think it could have been a great laptop but HP really screwed it up (for me at least) by not paying attention to the details.",0

B0D7MNFTQP,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,4 May 2025,the United States,False,"I recently purchased the Acer 2024 Chromebook Plus 514 Touchscreen, and I’m thoroughly impressed! From the moment I powered it on, everything felt smooth, fast, and responsive. The upgraded specs in the Chromebook Plus line really shine—whether I'm multitasking with multiple tabs, streaming HD content, or using Android apps, this Chromebook handles it all without breaking a sweat.

The 14-inch Full HD touchscreen is bright and vibrant with excellent touch responsiveness. It makes scrolling, zooming, and interacting with apps incredibly intuitive. The build quality feels premium, especially for a Chromebook in this price range, and the aluminum top cover gives it a sleek, modern look.

Battery life is another major win. I can easily get through a full day of work and still have charge left over. The keyboard is comfortable for long typing sessions, and the trackpad is smooth and accurate.

What really stands out is the seamless integration with Google Workspace and the added power of the Chromebook Plus series—enhanced AI features, faster performance, and more storage make it feel like a productivity powerhouse without the high cost.

If you're looking for a reliable, fast, and stylish Chromebook with a great touchscreen experience, the Acer Chromebook Plus 514 is a fantastic choice. Perfect for students, professionals, or casual users who want more than just the basics.

B0D7MNFTQP,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,15 April 2025,the United States,False,"My previous Chromebook was only about three years old and doing fine, but I was worried about tariffs increasing prices. So, I looked for an upgrade. I had not heard of a Chromebook ""Plus"", but the specs bore out what that meant when I noticed this device: 8 GB of RAM (twice what my previous device had) and a whopping 512 GB of storage (EIGHT times what my previous device was sporting).

The new unit was only 14 inches on the display compared to 15 on the prior model (both Acers), but the specs looked good and it was still a touchscreen. I had not actually looked at the price, so was impressed when I saw it was only $70 more than my existing device had cost in 2022, and still under $300.

When this new unit arrived I was immediately impressed by the speed, especially the fact that it detected the 6G network protocol on our recently purchased home router -- the first device to even be able to see it. But see the 6G it did, and network/internet access was very speedy. The greatest thing about Chromebooks (everything mirroring exactly what I already had) happened once again on this, my fourth Chromebook. It happened very quickly, in fact, and while it is early days still, everything seems faster. Notably, two things for which I use the device most:

First, I play a standard HTML5-developed tactical game that made my older Chromebook lag and lock up once in a while as pages loaded (or didn't). Especially when playing more intense areas for just 20-30 minutes, the old unit would get slower and slower until I had to close the game and restart it. When I left the game idle and returned, it would take 5-10 seconds for the animations on screen to come back to life. This is not the case with this new Acer. The game loads and runs quickly, and coming back hours later still shows animations moving around.

Second, I have Linux installed and added Visual Studio Code to my older Chromebook. VS Code runs on the older unit, but barely. After updates, sometimes it would lock up completely such that only a reboot of the Chromebook brought processes back into line. The new machine installed VS Code quickly and the application starts up fast. Updates to the application and extensions do not stutter or lag. Again, early days on this, but it looks like the title of my review is true: this is the first Chromebook I have had where I think it could do more than light browsing and email and act as a full laptop replacement. I logged into Microsoft 365 and it appears to be fully operational and snappy on performance, so this appears to handle intense web browsing, a development environment, and Microsoft Office without missing a beat.

Technical details: The performance of the new machine compared to the previous unit is not altogether surprising. It has 8 GB of RAM, far more ample storage, and runs a full i3 chip instead of Celeron. I went ahead and got geeky with benchmarking in GeekBench, and the old unit (slower processor and fewer cores) scored a 358 on single-core CPU and 610 on multi-core operations. This new Chromebook scored a 1159 on single and 4258 on multi. That's a significant step up, and the reason the device feels so snappy.

The speakers are nice and sound good. They can get pretty loud if you want them to, but on something like this you'd probably use the headphone jack or Bluetooth anyway. USB-to-HDMI works, but I was unable to get 5.1 sound through my A/V receiver even though the device supposedly support DTS. When I listened to something in 5.1 sound from the Chromebook's own speakers, it did feel like sounds were...around, the way such DTS schemes try to mimic surround, but this machine should not be expected to be perfect on that nor on signal outputs (though I do wonder why they even bother to add the ""DTS"" badge?).

One final touch: mine came with a carrying case, and I don't recall that being mentioned in the description. It's nothing extravagant, but most ""free"" cases I have received in the past have been glorified pieces of packaging material with a zipper glued on. This is a nice case, well-padded, and even has a side pouch suitable for a couple adapters and an HDMI cord, along with any manuals or warranty cards you might want to keep with you. The side pouch is not going to do well at holding a mouse or compact keyboard, but hey -- it was free.

Overall I am quite pleased that a Chromebook that has very meaningful upgrades to it and still comes in at under $300. This time the upgrades bring the device into near-laptop territory, even if you like to have a lot of browser tabs open or want to do some development and Office work. And one more shout-out for the MASSIVE amount of storage. If you add a 512GB microSD card (only $40-$50) you'll be up to a TERABYTE of total storage -- I consider that nothing short of phenomenal.

B00KU2JTR8,Amazon Customer,5.0,Excellent,10 August 2014,the United Kingdom,False,"I had hoped this Chromebook would be good, and thankfully I haven't been disappointed. It is very quick, very responsive and so far does virtually everything I want it to. The only slight let down for me is that currently Chrome OS wont let you access and NAS drives on your network, it is local or cloud access only!!! I havent dropped a star as I got round it by using an FTP add in, which for my purposes works fine, though you cant stream with it. All that having been said this feature is apparently in the makings and will hopefully make an appearance in a Chrome OS update.

The battery life is by far the best I have ever had on a laptop or net book, it even outlasts my Nexus 7 tablet! Some of the functions are much more intuitive then on other OS's, such as using two fingers to scroll on the touch pad.

The 14"" screen is bright and clear, there are better screens out there but for the price point this screen is still very good. The keyboard is nice to use, keys are positive, my only point here is the placement of the ""Search"" key which I keep hitting by mistake but I am sure I will get over that!

But b far one of the best aspects of the chromebook is the ability to put supervised accounts on it, meaning you can fully monitor and restrict what your kids do online, previously I have had to use a high end router/firewall and open dns to restrict content, with the supervised user function this is made very much easier and takes less then 3 minutes to set up!!!

All in all I am so far very pleased with this Chromebook, I have used it for 3 days now and have not yet needed (nor wanted to) go back to my windows 7 laptop.

B00KU2JTR8,Iain D,4.0,Great Machine let down by poor screen,17 August 2014,the United Kingdom,False,"For basic applications, web based browsing or viewing streaming videos this is a great choice.

Google docs is basic but sufficient for simple word processing - my main use - and saving to the cloud has definite advantages in securing your data so I'm not missing Windows. The keyboard is excellent, trackpad responsive and battery life good, I'm finding it lasts six to seven hours but that includes a lot of video.

Though plastic it does feel like a solid, good quality item. My only reservation is the screen which is very reflective and doesn't match the quality of the operating system or the rest of the build. I understand this has been manufactured to a price that keeps chromebooks cheaper than laptops but personally I would have happily paid another 25% for this machine with a better screen.

As chromebooks do everything most of us want from mobile computing I suspect these will supercede laptops and in the future we will see them made available to a better quality and at a broader range of prices.

Even with the poor screen using this machine has been enough to convert me to chromebooks and I'll be keeping an eye out for the next iteration by HP as they hopefully add a better screen.

B00KU2JTR8,Roi,5.0,Don't even miss my Windows laptop,17 July 2015,the United Kingdom,False,"I was given one of these at work and after a week bought this one for my wife without hesitation. Even bought a little Chromebox afterwards that serves as a media centre for the whole house.

Benefits:
- The battery life is amazing & you could dual run Linux (Chroot) on them if the Chrome OS doesn't offer a solution so you could run Kodi (XBMC).
- It serves it's purpose well and is great value for money.
- Auto updates quickly & you do not need to invest in Antivirus.
- You get great freebies with your purchase. Just search for Chromebook Goodies on Google. At the time we received 1TB free GDrive storage for 2 years!
- People at work always thinks it's a Mac.
- It's very light
- The Chrome store is extensive and has loads of useful freebies
- I prefer Chrome's MS Office solution even though it needs some work to truly replace MS Office

Cons:
- Not compatible with Silverlight so things like Sky NOW doesn't work
- Can only do Skype for Web ie. only chat but no video as yet. We use hangouts instead.
- Can't install itunes but there are alternatives

B0995RN7MK,Anthony Fitch,5.0,Excellent thin and light laptop,1 January 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"The screen is gorgeous. It's almost too good, because you'll need to spend some time faffing about with UI scaling to get menus and labels to a readable size unless you have incredible eyesight.
The battery does not achieve the hilariously optimistic advertised duration. I guess it might last that long if you simply switched it on and left it. Normal web browsing and other light tasks, it's easily good for 5 hours. Playing a game on it will suck the juice out in 2h or less.
Speakers are as good as could be expected in the form factor. The fan is audible but quiet under load.
I installed Garuda Linux on it and all the hardware was immediately recognised, including the keyboard lighting. The keyboard lighting has to be enabled in the ""Full Power"" mode, but once done it stays enabled in the ""balanced"" power mode. No driver issues with the wifi, touchpad and most of all the MX450 GPU.

while playing games, the mx450 makes the cpu goto 100 degrees,
it then throttles for 3 or 4 minutes to 70 degrees, which makes the framerate go down to 10
then once it goes to 70 degrees it goes to full speed again for 5 minutes, until it hits 100 degrees
rince repeat

didnt pick this up on first few months of having this.
if this didnt happen, great laptop

sending it back

great 14"" laptop, small, slim, light, and the GPU in it will make some light gaming possible for kids.
the screen and keyboard are great

we run it on a q24-h monitor when not using in laptop mode, and all it takes is a usb-c cable from the monitor to the laptop and its a desktop pc. (keyboard and mouse plugged into monitor's usb ports.
it will charge the laptop too all through 1 usb-c cable.

bought for my 12 year old.
initially had a 4800u with no gpu and the forest couldn't hold high framerates, and stuttered. same as sims 4.
the mx450 GPU helps with this, although its not a great GPU, its the best you can expect in such a slim 14"" laptop which we wanted, 15-16 inch were just too big/heavy which have 3050-3060 GPU's in them.

if you need more GPU grunt, get a 15-16"" laptop.

I do not regret buying this laptop and recommend it to anyone.

Besides this, the build is of a decent quality, with the keyboard being surprisingly good and the laptop feeling light but solid.

The main reason to buy this laptop in my case was the combination of SSD, small size, decent processor and low price. For my needs it is perfect. I use it as a productivity laptop for taking out of the house, running IDEs and other programs as well as word processing. It always runs fast for these tasks. I haven't tried to game on it, though I don't think it would be suitable for anything with graphics.

First day impression is impressive with almost full body build and decent writing keyboards.
In terms of specs Ryzen is clear winner for most budget orientented build in terms of performance comparable to Intel alternatives such as 8200u series but not compared to Intel 1000x series.

Positives:
+ Excellent Budget Gaming machine for 720 low - med settings however if u're planning to buy budget laptops
next year consider the newer generation laptops with Intel Xe Graphics or New Ryzen 4000 series.
+ Upgradability for SSD/Ram/Additional Properietary Battery to ( Main:30wAh + SIde:39 wAh = Total: 69 wAh )
+ Decent Keyboard typing experience
+ Relatively light weight even with additional battery

Middle Line:
= Decent features and connections for portable laptops
= 720 p camera is ok but definitely not for business only for casual video stream
= Decent bass to the speakers

Negatives:
- Heavy consumption of battery under normal use leading to realistic battery life of 1 hr min for heavy use - 3 hrs max for light use with main battery however with the additional battery the battery life goes up to 4 hrs for heavy use and almost 8 hrs for light use.
In high performance settings the power consumption is approx 1600mAh or nearly 16 Watts and considering the total amount with additional battery 69/16 = Below 4 hr of battery life for max performance ( gaming , intense tasks )
In casual or battery saver settings the power consumption is relative to amount of programs, screen brightness, bluetooth and sound which is approx from 1000mAh - 1500mAh(10 Watt - 14Watt) ranges which will net u 69/10 = 6.9 ( 6 - 7 hrs ) max theoretical battery life but realistically around 5 - 6 hrs battery life for casual usage.
- Battery drain or battery wear is bad. Within 3 - 4 months of casual usuage hsa led to 12% battery wear

( Explanation: AMD CPU in general consumes more power compared to Intel conterparts thus less battery life
than the Intel version of this laptop. )
- TN Panel on 2018 release date you may upgrade if u can find alternative ips panels online
- BackLight keyboard would've been an plus.

Really the only downside I've found is the battery. I suspect its just under-spec'd for the hardware contained and I suspect under sustained use if you got a couple of hours out of it you'd be doing well.

My computer was originally shipped from Dell with Windows 10 Home and was upgraded by this company to Windows 11 PRO but was not done properly! The software version was stuck on 21H2 when 24H2 was released right after I bought this computer. It would not update past 21H2 and started crashing repeatedly at least 2 times per day so I took it to a computer repair store and the owner called me and told me all of this. He remarked that he has been fixing computers for more than 30 years and was able to recognize these problems right away. I had to pay $109 to have my computer repaired because of the incompetence of this company! I would seriously LOOK ELSWHERE FOLKS as it is not worth it to buy from this company!!!

I have a Legion Go, a Steam Deck OLED and an Asus ROG Ally X, and I prefer the Steam Deck OLED for brightness, colour and battery life, the Asus ROG Ally X for raw power, and the Lenovo Legion Go for the detachable wireless controllers (much akin to the Nintendo Switch JoyCons, but MUCH more rugged in my opinion), and built-in kickstand, far superior to the one Nintendo used as an SD slot cover too.",0
B0CKXVCNKK,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,15 January 2025,France,False,"Alors soyons claire cette console et plutôt ce type de console a changé ma façon de jouer, je suis joueur pc depuis que j'ai 16 ans des jeux que je j'achète sur steam j'en ai a la pelle hors a mon époques ou j'étais encore adolescent et même longtemps après jouer sur un clavier souris devant une tv ou un bureau ne me gènais pas beaucoup

Mais avec le temps et une vie de famille ma façon de consommer le jeu a changé, ma façon de consommer aussi, j'ai décidé de changer de bord et de partir sur console Xbox...

Le problème numéro 1 c'est que je me suis vite rendu compte de la limitation technique et que ben ce n'était pas mon ordinateur, donc perte de mes jeux et de choisir soit même les options de ses paramètres graphique et périphériques

Steamos installer sur ma console légion go, partage familial avec 5 amis a moi 3800 jeux en tout...

Avec concession je fais tourner tout mes jeux même les plus gourmands comme silent Hill remake

Je ne fais pas tourné a 60fps personnellement a la manette et de plus si le jeux n'est pas un jeu de compétition comme overwatch ou Css c'est vraiment pas gênant je bloque d'ailleurs a 35 fps la plupart du temps

Cette console je ne dirais pas quelle a changé ma vie mais presque elle m'a en tout cas permis de reprendre une petite activité d'un plaisir sont je n'avais plus le temps...

Le soir tu rentres du travail, tu vois la tv occupé par ta femme, du coup il ya constamment un partage et je n'avais pas envie de partir seul dans une chambre pour jouer ou même le soir pour ne pas la réveiller etc

Vous m'avez compris jouer en portable dans la plupart du temps dans d'excellentes conditions où on veut est vraiment une idée de génie et en plus avec Steam os bazzite c'est encore plus génial cette os est un mélange des deux meilleurs monde entre console et pc

On a le côté convivial et pratique d'une console et le côté tuning d'un ordinateur

Tuning par la possibilité d'installer des applications, des mods, des patch fr, choix des graphismes de la résolution du type de périphérique de sont système d'exploitation et j'en passe

Et pratique dans le côté plug and play, allumé ça console lancer le jeux en moins de 30 sec, ne pas se soucier des drivers a installé, ne pas se soucier des applications en arrière plan et de l'optimisation. Qu'on se donne un mal fou sur windows de part ça lourdeurs incroyable

B0CKXVCNKK,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,14 February 2025,France,False,"⭐ Avis :
Après plusieurs semaines avec la Lenovo Legion Go , je peux dire que c'est une console portable qui apporte un vrai plus par rapport à ses concurrentes. Voici mon retour détaillé.

✔ Les points positifs :
✅ Un écran plus grand (8,8 pouces) que ses concurrents, ce qui améliore énormément le confort de jeu.
✅ Puissance supérieure.
✅ Personnalisation avancée : possibilité d'installer SteamOS pour en faire une vraie console portable Steam , mais plus puissante.
✅ La sacoche fournie : un détail appréciable qui permet de protéger la console et d'éviter qu'elle ne prenne la poussière.

❌ Les points négatifs :
⚠ Un peu plus lourd que ses concurrents, ce qui peut fatiguer après de longues séances.
⚠ La disposition de certaines touches peut être un peu gênante selon la taille des mains (pour ma part, n'ayant pas de grandes mains, ça ne me dérange pas).
⚠ La nécessité d'avoir des connaissances en OS si on veut vraiment l'optimiser avec SteamOS .
⚠Une batterie qui se décharge trop rapidement et un câble de chargeur fourni un peu trop court à mon goût.
🎮 Mon expérience d'utilisation :
J'adore jouer sur la Legion Go principalement grâce à son écran plus grand et à sa puissance supplémentaire . Je l'utilise surtout en mode console portable , et honnêtement, elle fait mieux que ces concurrent sur plusieurs points. Pour ceux qui veulent une alternative plus puissante et plus immersive, c'est un excellent choix !

💡 Conclusion :
Si vous cherchez une console portable puissante , avec un grand écran et une belle fluidité , la Legion Go est une option incroyable. Elle demande peut-être un peu d'adaptation, surtout en fonction de la taille des mains et de son poids, mais elle vaut largement le détour !

Not for laptops though. I ordered 3 spectre laptops from the warehouse and no one was in decent working order: one had a disconnected camera (HP assistance wasn't able to fix neither), one had missing windows keys, and this one had a fan that wasn't spinning.

The battery life is very good with the 1080p screen and it charges really quickly providing you're not using it at the same time. The problem is it's just not well built despite the fact it looks and feels great. My first unit had issues with flex in the chassis and lots of creaking and this 2nd unit now has developed a fault with the rubber feet that prevent the screen from pressing against the keyboard when the lid closed. The rubber foot has collapsed inside the chassis, not very good for a high end device that's had very little usage.

I had no doubts about buying another Erazer and this one looked like a good buy but.........
It has windows 11 which is a nightmare
It has a sticker for McAfee but you only get a trial version
The one major and confusing let down is the Power Modes system which completely ruins the laptop with its really dumb 4 options, one makes it feel like its 20 years old, the entertainment one makes the fan burst with noise for no obvious reason and its very loud
The only good thing the laptop has going for it is being slightly better for gaming but other than that the older laptop I had performs miles better in every other department and its about 8 years older

I've always had a hard time PC shopping, and I've always wanted a gaming laptop - yea im one of ""those guys"", and this lil devil really gives you a run for your money! It's almost like Acer themselves saw me purchase their office laptop for $500 in at Wal-Mart circa 2010 in a futile attempt to game - took my disappointment and expanded on improving!

If you're on a budget AND truly lack space or power bar location for a tower this machine is FOR YOU! awesome speed and power when gaming even new titles like DOOM: eternal, of course the CPU get quite hot BUT the cooling system they've installed I personally find great! I keep mine elevated on an old laptop cooling base, it's perfect. Some may find the fan noise to be too loud but it's never bothered me and never been loud enough to hear over mic.

THE ONLY THING you drastically need is another 8gb of RAM. The machine only comes with one stick, so grab another on your way out of the checkout. SUPER easy to install, MAKE SURE you have some sort of plastic pry tool that wont scratch up the case. The case is held with plastic snaps which i don't agree but don't cause major issues. 16 gb is MORE than enough RAM for any game you wish to play i promise you.

Running like a dream so far and I'm SUPER satisfied with the value and performance.

I bought this laptop as a gift for my son so he could complete coursework, take notes when studying etc; said laptop was used for nothing else as he also has a desktop pc at home. For the record it has been used for two years 1 month (this wasn't a daily driver work horse) the only reason it has lasted this long is because it was hardly used. As far as the laptop goes in its use for workflow, great, but Lenovo have created a problem that consumers will pay dearly for, the quality of the materials used for the hinge mechanism. If you use this particular laptop everyday It will not last a year before the hinge snaps clean through at its plastic fixings.

B09SG6RNT4,G L,1.0,DEFECTIVE DESIGN - DO NOT BUY,12 April 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"I purchased this laptop roughly 7 months ago for personal home use.

After a bit of Googling, I came across a 47 page(!) thread on Lenovo's forums filled with posts from owners of the same model who've experienced the same problem after using the laptop for a similar amount of time.

My laptop should be covered under warranty but Lenovo have been an absolute nightmare to deal with, taking days to respond to queries or offer any of the support they are legally obligated to provide. This hinge issue is common for this particular model of laptop and is undoubtedly the result of some serious design flaw or manufacturing defect.

Great battery life something around 10-12 hours for myself. Granted this varies greatly depending on how you use it. But I regularly have multiple things going on at once and rarely do I have any issues. Its sturdy doesn't feel cheap in the slightest, and feels very well built. And its so lightweight.

B07DPC4PLG,Tony Wills,4.0,Great build quality and lovely to use,6 October 2019,the United Kingdom,False,"Great build quality and lovely to use.. I use this laptop for home/media and it's fast enough for most purposes.. installed popular tv/movie player and this worked very well, youtube and movie playing no problems at all, but games at not really playable unless they are a few years old.. yes it's got a vega graphics card but it's intergrated into the motherboard and as such runs at very low speeds.. Tomb Raider no chance, need for speed will runs in 720p as will most games over 2 years old but the fan spins up and the system runs hot.. wouldnt trust it for more than a couple of hours before it would do some serious damage to something on the board, it gets that hot.

Other than games this is a great laptop, all metal body, lovely touch screen, Ryzen Cpu, Vega graphics, 8GB memory and a fast SSD (only 128GB though).. works well in tablet mode but is more at home as a laptop. I changed the SSD to a large M.2. Drive (which was very easy) and use this all the time.

Also the fans only speed up when gaming (firmware is upgraded) but is very quiet in normal operation. Would whole heartly recommend this great little hybrid laptop/tablet.",0
B07DPC4PLG,Mark W,1.0,Lovely little 2 in 1 laptop if it lasted!,3 January 2019,the United Kingdom,False,"Had this delivered today and I must confess it's even better than I imagined. The build quality screams ""Premium device"". It's the same foot print size as my Dell ultra book, which has a 12 inch screen. The screen is bright and clear, the sound, from such a thin device, is amazing. It performs well and is responsive, even to touch. The initial boot up was cool, cortana actually worked and made sense while it talked me through the setup. If you're looking for a portable, light weight, 2 in 1 laptop, then you can't go wrong with this.

Update -
Had to return this and get a replacement. The wifi was having issues, loss of speed and connectivity. Noticed that some pages were not loading and were reporting no internet connectivity. Ran the usual Windows 10 diagnostics and no issues were reported. I then started getting issues with live video streaming, such as twitch and live channels on BBC iplayer, they would slow/stutter and then grind to a halt, I'd have to refresh the page to get them back. This happened every few minutes. I ran speed test along side these issues and noticed the wifi speed fluctuating a lot, going from full speed 60mbps down to 1mbps and then 0 when it would disconnect the video feed. Googled the issue and found it being reported quite a lot. I had already updated the BIOS and all the drivers, disabled power management on the network card, disabled the firewall etc. All the suggested ""fixes"" didn't work. So I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement. I tested the laptop, prior to updating anything, and it didn't display any of the issues that I'd had with the previous laptop. However, I then went through the same process, as with the previous laptop, updated everything, BIOS, drivers etc. I then experienced the same wifi issues. Went through the same ""fixes"" as before, again without any positive results, so I contacted Amazon once more and reported the issue. Amazon offered a full refund upon return of the laptop and suggested that I could use the money to get a different laptop. I was reluctant to do this, since I don't think I'd get something of similar quality for the price I'd paid, so whilst I was chatting online to Amazon I decided to investigate the issue further. I then noticed that the HP update utility had downloaded and installed ""HP connection optimizer"" which the description said ""Recovery tool for YB/Red-X Comm modules"", it looked suspicious, so I uninstalled it. The wifi issue still remained. I then manually updated the wifi card drivers and rebooted the laptop. Tested the wifi again, the speed was no longer fluctuating and streaming live video worked flawlessly, so I can only deduce that the software, provided by HP, was the issue after all!

So if anyone else experiences the same issues, it looks like HP Connection Optimizer could be the culprit causing it.

The laptop now works without any issues and I still believe this was a good purchase, once the wifi issues were resolved.

UPDATE : Had this laptop now for a little less than a year, haven't used it anywhere near as much as intended. Yesterday I switched it on and noticed that it wasn't quite sitting flat on the desk, there appeared to be a bulge at the bottom of it and none of the 4 corner feet were touching the desk. Having remembered receiving several emails about product recalls, due to battery issues, which I had followed their instruction and used the HP utility to check if my product was affected, which it wasn't. I can only assume it's the battery. The laptop does power on, but also powered off by itself a few times, within minutes of powering on. I've reported the issue to Amazon and they've agreed a return and refund. Damn shame the laptop has gone like this, it's a lovely bit of kit and I think I will have difficulty finding anything, of similar spec, build quality and price, to replace it.

B07DPC4PLG,Al Campos,2.0,Looks good but that's about it,18 January 2019,the United Kingdom,False,It's well built beutifull and it ends there. It suffers from processor throttling the AMD 7 and AMD Vega 10 perform well if it weren't for the heating. But the worst is the screen which I cant understand at 100% brightness its impossibly dim and the the battery 4.5 hours on 720p film at 50% brightness so that's why I take my Galaxy tablet on flights. So you cant use it outside because you wont see the screen then because you have to set the brightness to 100% anyway. And not mentioning the lack of firmware for the AMD. I returned mine and got a Huawei matebook x pro yes I had to sacrifice but that 3k screen and Nvidea 2Gb Graphic card. The Vega 10 graphics on the Envy come with 256mb I think.

B07DPC4PLG,Vernal Scott,4.0,A Good HP Product Seriously Upstaged By Alternative Competitors,29 August 2019,the United Kingdom,False,"There is much to like about this HP Envy x360 laptop; sound, screen, flexible viewing modes, overall satisfying performance, etc. However, its attributes were markedly less impressive when viewed next to a similarly priced Amazon Warehouse Deal Huawei Matebook X Pro, with its 3K screen and gob smacking audio. The HP just could not compete. That said, at the time of buying, the 'as new' non-deal price for 256GB Matebook base model is £300 more than the 128GB HP Envy, so I was simply lucky to get the used Matebook for the same price as the Envy. So the Envy will have to go back, not because it isn't good, but because the X Pro competition is evidently better. If I do have a complaint about the Envy it's the noisy fan, which is far too intrusive in my experience. Also, the screen is gorgeous, but it is somewhat oversaturated and not a match against a 3K. Oh yes, it works with a stylus, but this wasn't included in the box, although an HDMI dongle was. Still, it's a worthy buy for the price and features. Just don't view it next to anything better.

B07GBDDCRV,Mr_Zambezi,4.0,A strange and confusing keyboard layout,9 February 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"I bought this laptop as a robust but light alternative to my Dell XPS 13, so that I could continue working while away for a few days. The machine is clearly robust, has a clear screen and the battery seems to last for about 7 or 8 hours of ""normal"" use, of MS Office, editing images etc. It has numerous ports for peripherals including three USB ports, which is good. My problem comes with the location of the keys on the keyboard.

To start with, the <<Ctrl>> and <<Fn>> keys are reversed. The UK keyboard normally has <<Ctrl>> in the bottom left and after using this layout for the past 20 years or more, it is difficult having to get used to the <<Fn>> key being in that location, with <<Ctrl>> being the next key to its right. Keyboard shortcuts such as <<Ctrl>> X, <<Ctrl>> V and <<Ctrl>> Z have become so much of a conditioned reflex but with this PC, you need to think about them each time, with many failures because your reflex let you down.

At least these keys have the correct symbol written on them. Other keys have been changed without warning. The keyboard shows the @ key to be shifted 2. In reality, <<Shift>> 2 gives you double-quotes, as it would on a traditional UK keyboard and the double-quote key at <<Shift>> single-quote gives you the @ symbol. Sooner or later you will need the £ key. It is also in the ""correct"" place, at <<Shift>> 3, which the keyboard tells you will generate the hash symbol #. On my X260, I get a # with my back-slash key and the ~ symbol from its shifted version, shown as a vertical bar on the keyboard. These keys are less commonly used than the regular alpha-numeric keys but actually finding them, when you need them, can involve an unwelcome voyage of discovery.

When I first obtained my X260, last November, I thought that all I had to do was find the appropriate keyboard type and configure the computer to it. I do not know, this may be a non-UK arrangement that I have never seen before but perhaps it could be re-configured by the correct action in Settings? If this is the case, I have not found out how to do it.

In summary: My X260 appears to be robust, with a clear screen, a long-lasting battery which will connect to all my peripherals but it is let down by its strange and confusing keyboard layout.

B01B3JED7W,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,31 October 2017,the United States,False,"I wish I had purchased a chromebook years ago. I was familiar with them from having purchased them for my wife and granddaughter but was used to Windows. I finally got tired of Windows unreliability and purchased this very functional Business Chromebook for a very, very reasonable price (under $200.00). I powered it on and was prompted to sign onto my google account. All of my chrome bookmarks, settings, etc. popped right up. It does everything I need a computer for, which is primarily work (I would say that I use it 80 percent of the time for Drive, answering email, and web search) with occasional video streaming. I am one of those people who often have several tabs open at once and this chromebook handles that easily.

The only reasons that I don't give this wonderful Chromebook five stars is that there is an occasional issue with Spotify streaming on it where Spotify will pause momentarily and then resume. I am not sure if this is a Spotify or chrome issue but the problem apparently exists across the Chromebook galaxy. Also, there is no dedicated ""delete"" button. Deletes are easily accomplished by depressing and holding the ""alt"" and then the ""backspace"" key. This was a bit awkward initially but I quickly got used to it. Similarly, pull-down menus outside of Google Drive/Docs are obtained by pressing the ""alt"" key and the right bottom mouse pad. Again, I got used to it quickly (I am 66 and if I can do it you can too!). The keyboard is also a bit smaller than I am used to but I quickly was typing away after a break in period. Apparently not all google/droid/chrom apps are operative on this Chromebook just yet but Google is apparently working quickly to make sure this happens. I have only found one or two that aren't adaptable, and they aren't something that I normally use much anyway. Your results may differ.

I have seen thinner Chromebooks but this is certainly very light and thin enough to bring with you just about anywhere. I wouldn't use it for game playing but it is fine for literally anything else. It's a terrific work tool for business or school.

I got mine second hand and for the price they are being offered these days, with an i5 and about 6-8 GB RAM it will make a great machine to do relatively heavy computing tasks. Keyboard is great (the last Lenovo 'true' keyboard, before they switched to the sunken keys, a la MacBook), screen is bright and at HD resolution does the job, build quality is excellent, trackpad and buttons are comfortable, battery (depending on what kind you get) will last an okay time (3-5h in my case).

B004WNAYS4,Miss I.,4.0,"brilliant laptop, had trouble with this refurbished model (screen broke), but fixed and still very good price overall",9 January 2016,the United Kingdom,False,"Good things:

it works, it's fairly quick. Comfortable keyboard, good ergonomics with where headphones and power cord attach. Sound is good, screen res is good. It's a good size and not too heavy. Doesn't feel flimsy, at all. I like windows 7. It never crashes, even with loads of tabs open.

Bad things:

battery life only about 3 hours. Also I had this problem where the screen would flash black (only had laptop about 3 months, and using often but fairly carefully), and a week after the that the screen went grey - completely unusable. Contacted the seller asking for refund/replacement - got no reply to any of my messages. Found out that if you take the battery out, and hold the power button for 60seconds, it releases excess charge (i don't know technicalities) - and now it's working again. Disappointed that it did this after only 3 months, think it's actually a pretty old model (2010). Hope it doesn't do that often with the screen cutting out. Thankful it's fixable. Also I uninstalled all the useless flashy Lenovo stuff that takes up CPU/ slows it down.

EDIT : the trick for the battery has stopped working. For a bit it only worked when plugged in, then it stopped working altogether. I spent £90 on new battery, and it still didn't work.
Then it stopped working totally... Took it to a shop, it turned out the screen was broken. Got new screen (£50) and fitted (extra £30) , and now it works PERFECTLY and the shop guy said ""I have never ever seen any problems with lenovo laptops before this"", and I have a super extra long-life battery as well.

I emailed a guy called Paul who I queried regarding certain details with and subsequently ordered through Amazon. Everything has arrived now and my summary is as follows:

- Lenovo T420
- Keyboard (UK) immaculate
- Touchpad immaculate (still has the nobbly texture)
- Screen has small mark (pen stab?) - not very noticeable
- AC Adapter - Lenovo compatible brand
- Battery - Not had long enough to see if it holds its charge

I purchased this due to an ailing T61 which has served me well for some time but the fan is slowly dying a death now and she is getting a little long in the tooth. From an initial scan, this is going to do just what I need it to. I am fairly familiar with the innards of Lenovo kit enough to know that it's well built, easy to upgrade and pretty durable though really the only potential upgrade might be an SSD.

While I'm sure there are faster laptops out there, for my purposes this is more than sufficient. I won't be installing any games on it and will be mostly using it for my 'around the house' laptop to surf, play music etc. If you want a top end gaming laptop you're probably best advised to get your wallet out and pay your dues.

I recommend using these guys and if you need something that isn't specifically in the listing, give them a call/email and see what they can do. The people I spoke to knew their stuff and were very friendly.

The aluminium is nice on the lid

The bad-
Battery life is not great
Trackpad is too small
Webcam placement is just awful
Doesn't open with one finger like competitors

Overall it's not bad as such but when your talking £1000+ for a laptop you almost expect them to have ironed out some of these kinks, a similar priced MacBook Pro has all these bases covered.

B07CZHHGK9,Hamzah,2.0,Great until the screen stopped working,14 January 2020,the United Kingdom,False,This was a great laptop until the bottom half of the screen stopped working. Sent it in for repairs but they were unable to fix it so a refund was issued.,2
B0D67651YC,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,29 September 2024,the United States,False,"My overall experience has been very satisfying. It’s easy to setup, it’s fast and quiet. I use it for programming and not gaming. I’ve been running it every day for about a month and it’s as smooth as the first day. I recommend you update the bios because the chip is an Intel 13th generation model, and some have a manufacturing defect which could cause the CPU to produce voltages higher than specifications. Do your research to get more information about this. Had I known about this defect before purchasing this product I would’ve picked something else, but so far, it’s been a pleasure to work with.",0

B09R63Z5L7,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,24 March 2023,the United States,False,"Was upgrading from a 10+ year old HP Pavilion that took ages to power on much less most tasks. Searching for a laptop was not easy and I was not expecting to pick the most sustainable option but the specs looked good and the price was great, so why not?! Now let's look at the pros and cons.

PROS:

+Keyboard is backlit and TACTILE. Has good depth and travels nicely. (R and E keys are backwards/green which doesn't bother me, and if anything is a fun quirk)
+Texture of computer is very nice and I love the gray color with the yellow/white/black specks throughout, gives it character. Looks fantastic and I've had people think I was using a Macbook at first glance? Definitely doesn't look like one after closer examination but people looking for a possible dupe, this one is sleek! Also no fingerprints all over, since the texture is great at hiding them.
+Screen is a matte texture which I prefer and it looks great! I am totally ok with not having a touchscreen but I understand this could be make or break for some people. Screen looks good and I have no problems watching 1440p videos!
+Quick and easy setup out of the box
+Battery life is solid for me, 4-6 hours multitasking/playing music, miles better than the <2 I had from my old PC.
+Feel like I might run out of space quickly with the 512 GB SSD but upgrading to a 1 or 2 TB is very easy, according to a YouTube tutorial. Like only a few minutes to change it and minimal things to unhook/move.
+Touchpad is nice and smooth, able to be replaced if needed and the buttons are tactile enough. I did opt to include the Vero mouse and sleeve when purchasing and I am actually a big fan of the mouse. Sleeve is nice too!
+Downloaded Steam and Fallout New Vegas just to see how it could handle games, I only play PC occasionally and it ran buttery smooth. I'm sure it can handle a stronger game engine but definitely nothing too taxing. Wouldn't recommend AAA games from this gen but apparently it can play Elden Ring at a low FPS.
+Price is fantastic and I was shocked at how low the price was with the specs it had.

CONS (Moreso points I am ""eh"" about) (Could be better could be worse):

-While the screen is nice, some textures/shadows could look better but really not a bad screen at all. Sometimes when opening a new window on a screen the window will display a strange pixelated shadow, but that doesn't bother me. Not sure if an Acer problem or a specific problem from my laptop.
-Speakers are on the bottom of the PC so sound could get lost if not on a surface. I've had no complaints listening to videos/music while sitting at a desk, using the desk stand included in the box helps throw the sound a little more. I do opt tot use my bluetooth headphones more and set up was quick and easy.
-Numerical keyboard is a little small but once you get used to it, its a non issue.
-No SD card/CD DVD port but has an LAN/HDMI port which is a solid trade off. SD adapters are thankfully not pricey, neither are disk drives.

The time I've had with this laptop is short but I have really enjoyed it since purchasing. I find myself enjoying being on my computer more and I am not sure how I made it this long without upgrading. Once offsetting the little bit of bloatware it comes with, it runs like a champ. The overall character of the shell of the laptop is so enjoyable and I find myself looking at the design. It has charm and that is VERY rare in a PC in 2023.

While I found it to be a chore to power on my old PC, it is WAY harder to get me to turn this one off! Highly recommend.

B09R63Z5L7,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,8 June 2023,the United States,False,"UPDATE:

I've been using it for about 3 months now. Problems are mostly Windows 11 issues. It occasionally drops the wifi service. The router is fine (all our other devices have internet) and research indicates this is happening quite a bit on Windows 11. There are other similar types of issues with trying to use multiple displays, etc, that seem to be more on the Windows side. In fact, I thought the machine had fried on me last night but it turns out to be a Windows update thing. (The laptop got so hot I had to be careful how I handled it. Had to move it next to an AC vent and it took 3+ hours before it would boot up again.)

The camera and display leave something to be desired and it would be nice to have a second hdmi port for my 2nd tv monitor, but (as mentioned below) this is just a temporary machine for me. For the price point, this is a good deal. That said, if it responds to the next Windows update in similar fashion, I'll add to this review. Hoping that was a one-time nightmare.

Original review...
It's time to invest in a high end laptop again so I bought this unit to decide if I want to go back to Windows or stay with Mac. (The kids will use this for homework in the fall.) While the built in display is not greatest, I am pleasantly surprised by its performance. I'm not taxing it by running a lot of heavy applications but it can keep up with both Chrome and Edge simultaneously open, each with lots and lots of tabs open, several spreadsheets, Discord, Telegram, RDP, PuTTy, mail, calendar, Adobe Reader and Pro, Scrivener, Notepad, Visual Studio Code, and Zoom or Webex - all at the same time. (I've got the Intel i7 with 16GB RAM.)

B09R63Z5L7,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,27 March 2023,the United States,False,"This is a good computer in the $500 to $600 range. The screen is crisp and bright, the keyboard is backlit and comfortable, and the trackpad is decent. Feels more expensive than $500 and will be fine for everyday things like youtube, web surfing, office docs, etc. The design is appealing and you can easily access the internal components of the computer.

I would suggest upgrading to 24 gigs of RAM by simply swapping out the 8 gig ram stick. (The other 8 gigs of RAM are soldered to the motherboard, unfortunately.) I also upgraded to wifi 6e as well. Everything was very easy to install and I had a nice boost in performance.

The upgrades will cost you between $50 to $100 and will take 15 minutes to install/configure. Items I used RAM and wifi card are linked below.

Lastly, the computer has a good selection of ports, HDMI, USB-C, ethernet, USB 3.0 x2, and a single USB 2.0. More than enough for most users.

Using this laptop I would say the battery life isn’t great when using the second screen but it does the job. I didn’t opt for the touch screen but that is optional if it is to your liking.

B08KY4V659,John Coffey,4.0,Great laptop but could have been even better,19 January 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"This a great laptop; its fast, nicely made, has plenty of processor power and RAM memory and the battery goes on for hours. The chassis is light and surprisingly small. By comparison, my wife bought an Acer Swift 3 14 inch a while ago and I thought that was small and slim but this Asus model is about a third smaller than even that one. The Asus' screen is indeed 14inches and yet the chassis is so small it looks like a 13 incher. The screen itself is fully matt, i.e. there is no reflection from it whatsoever. My old lappy had a gloss screen and this ones colours don't look quite so vibrant because of the matt effect screen I think. You can of course increase the colour saturation though if needed. No disc drive and only 2 USB3 ports means it quickly runs out of data connection points though (my mouse takes one of the USB connections permanently). No ethernet port either, which is another limiting factor when you don't have wifi but the wifi 6 adapter is excellent in terms of its coverage. The backlit keyboard was a must have for me and its OK but there is a major flaw with the keyboard and that is that the writing on the keys is pale grey on medium grey and in daylight, at certain angles, the keyboard becomes virtually unreadable. Of course its a qwerty keyboard, so touch typers may be OK with the main letter keys but all the ancillary and extra function keys are a devil to read/find. Its so bad that I keep the keyboard lit on maximum even during the day. I don't know what Asus was thinking, because otherwise this is a very good laptop.",5

B08JQJ5RKK,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,30 April 2024,the United States,False,"It's still very early days so I can't comment on durability yet. But I will provide some opinions and commentary.

This Acer Swift Go 14 replaced a new Asus Zenbook 14 with OLED screen and Core Ultra 155h. The Asus arrived with a defective touchpad so it went back to BestBuy.

So enough history. I had been lusting after this Acer unit for quite a number of months so, when the Asus went south and Amazon dropped the price on the Acer, I ordered it. It arrived in two days (as promised). Came with a zippered case (which I haven't even opened yet).

Forgot that it had a touchscreen; I'll never use it as the screen doesn't fold back into tablet mode so it's essentially worthless to me; they could have left it out and sold it for less. I guess everybody wants an iPad wannabe, eh?

The screen itself, however, is sharp and clear and very bright. I tend to keep it at 50% brightness as I computer indoors. The 1920x1200 resolution is perfect. I keep it at 125% magnification and can read the small lettering just fine with my glasses.

The keyboard has plenty of key travel (unlike MacBooks) and the touchpad, which I don't think is a Synaptics, operates well. It's not oversized (as Macs tend to be) but feels right to me. Tapping, two-finger scrolling, three- and four-finger swipes are supported (as is a traditional ""click"" if you press).

Performance: Very speedy; feels as fast if not faster than the Asus Zenbook I returned. If I could install Windows 10, I might do that only because Win11 gets in my way with its incessant nagging and suggesting and whining. Maybe when I figure out how to turn off all the annoyances, I'll be happier with Win11.

General Design: One of the things I've liked about Acer non-gaming laptops/notebooks is their ""vanilla"" design ethos. Keep it simple and clean. The case of this Swift is a lovely somewhat squared-off ""chiseled"" look in the same sense as an Ioniq 5. I think the manufacturing execution is not quite Apple quality--the case port edges are a little sharper than Apple would permit--but everything plugs in the way it should. The keyboard is recessed below the palm rest a bit so your greasy fingers won't end up leaving marks on the screen when you close the lid. Speaking of the keyboard, it's nice and large with well-spaced keys and adequate backlighting.

Battery life: Ran it for about 6+ hours with lots of web use. I think I had about 50% left. No complaints.

As I think about it, the Acer reminds me most of my 13"" 2012 MacBook Pro although it's a larger screen, higher resolution, incredibly faster, and about 1.25 lbs lighter. :D That Mac was, IMHO, the pinnacle of Mac laptop design. I think Acer has done a great job with this unit.

I'll report back in a few months regarding any QC issues that, hopefully, won't pop up.

B08JQJ5RKK,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,31 October 2022,the United States,False,"As a relatively inexpensive and light laptop, the Acer Swift 3 is pretty solid. It's not a heavy duty laptop and it isn't going to be a great option for gaming or video editing or anything that requires a lot of processing power, but as a general purpose laptop for surfing the web or watching YouTube videos it's going to be perfectly functional.

It weighs in around 2.6-2.8lbs (my scale isn't very precise and the reading fluctuated between the two after several tries), which makes it quite easy to carry around without feeling weighed down. The construction feels about what I would expect for a computer in this price range, which is to say it's not top quality but it's not flimsy either. The keyboard is not overly clicky, although it is a bit louder than i would like. I am generally not a fan of laptop keyboards as I prefer a bit more responsiveness but all things considered it's not bad. The backlighting on the keyboard works well.

The Cinebench score was a rather pedestrian 5000. But regardless of benchmarks, I have found it works perfectly well for my everyday needs. I can have a full-screen video running on one screen while surfing the web on another with no lag or hiccups. I keep several programs open all the time (including Chrome which is a serious memory hog) and the laptop doesn't have any performance issues. Considering the price point I am very satisfied with its performance.

The one negative about the setup is that the RAM cannot be upgraded (I got 8gb and wanted 16gb but wasn't going to pay the ridiculous cost difference to buy it pre-installed). I also would have liked 1 more usb port, but 2 is pretty standard so it's not something I would hold against it. Overall I am very satisfied with this laptop. If you don't carry your laptop around very much you might consider looking around for other options because there are probably other more performant options around this price range at the cost of more weight. But if you want a portable, inexpensive laptop that performs well on common everyday tasks then this is a great choice.

As with every other one I had the first thing I did was disable the auto-updates. This seems to ensure Windows lives past the first 3-4 years. Do not believe what they tell you about Microsoft updates, they work for a while and once they surpass your machine's specs, they destroy it. Once you make sure you have installed software from everyone but Microsoft, then things work well for much longer. In the 3 years it has developed a tendency to throw blue screens when it tries to come off the screen saver or do anything particularly demanding video-wise. The battery died completely after 15 months. The sound is terrible, there is no camera. I bought this for £350 straight from Dell. I would never buy another inspiron at this price now, but I had no better options in 2010. All in all, absolutely never buy on of these second hand! Never buy any Dell second hand.

Problem 1 : getting it to accept updates from the dell drivers website is difficult.
Problem 2 : for some reason, despite having no other users, windows 7 will not allow me to update certain drivers, something to do with admin access.
Problem 3 : the McAfee it comes with is hard to remove and replace with something less annoying.
Problem 4 : sometimes the touchpad pointer goes berserk and jumps all over the place.

B0799979K9,MiguelN,3.0,"Hardware is great, Windows 10 disappinting.",20 February 2019,the United Kingdom,False,"I've owned several Dell PCs over the years, both laptops and desktops. I still have my old Precision 17in workstation laptop (purchased back in 2011). This new Dell laptop I just purchased looks great and feels good. I have no issues with Dell products. My issue is with Microsoft Windows 10. I don't like it. My first experience with Windows 10 was with a new workstation laptop at work I got three months ago. Basically I don't like the whole set up and the difficulties in trying to do things that are very easy to do with Windows 7.
I purchased the XPS 13 for business use and I wanted one that is light weight and compact. Though I dreaded having no choice but to get one with Windows 10.
I am starting to get use to it, but it take me more time to do simple things that are quick with Windows 7. One major disappointment is not being able to pair my iPhone with the laptop. It seems there are major bugs with this feature on the Windows side. I read lots of complaints from Windows 10 users who experienced not being able to connect their phones with their laptops, even after trying all kinds of fixes supplied by both Microsoft and users.
You know, I've been working in the high tech industry since 1977 and saw the emergence of personal computers in the 80's and onwards. I would have thought by now that all of the complexities inherent in these machines would have been worked out and 'in this day and age' problems I have been experiencing (both with my work's PC - I use it for 3D CAD and my new Dell laptop) would have been a thing of the past. I guess not.
Good thing I never upgraded my old workstation laptop to Windows 10.

Follow up: I finally managed to get my iPhone to connect with the laptop. This is an intermittent condition though. It works, for a while, but if I leave the laptop alone for a while, or close the lid and later come back an open it I've lost my connection.
Then, I cannot re-connect because the phone does not show up on the list of networks. Technology, I am less and less impressed with it!

It is a brilliant piece of kit, powerful, stylish and gorgeous to handle. The lid (screen) does not feel wobbly like a lot of other laptops in this category did when I tested them. The laptop is made a one solid piece of aluminium and feels strong and looks stylish - and lightweight too, as I found when I took it on plane travels. The high resolution screen gives a beautiful picture; I would not have expected that a touch screen would be of particular use, but I would not be without it; it makes scrolling those long web pages a breeze!
The machine itself is powerful enough to cope without problems with a dozen applications open at the same time. It streams videos and TV very well; the microphone is OK, but with earphones, the sound is very good. I do not often award the maximum score to products, as there is usually room for improvements, but it would be unfair to give this laptop less than 5 stars. I understand that this particular model has been replaced by a newer model and I would urge anybody to grab one while they can, even if the new model is likely to be good too.
I have not used it for gaming, and I have not used the camera either, so I cannot comment on these aspects.",0

B08BJCH5QQ,Mr. S. Townsley,5.0,A laptop with plenty of premium features,7 May 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"Intel processors have dominated PCs for decades but in recent years AMD have produced some great processors that are powerful and low power. This PC has one of them. It is very fast and easily replaced my old laptop that had an Intel i7 7th generation processor. A fast SSD and 8gb of memory made it good value. I would have liked the option of a 16gb memory model because you can't upgrade the memory.

The screen is bright and can be tilted to a variety of angles. This is good for using it on an ordinary table rather than a desk. The laptop supports Windows Hello, the passwordless face detection technology. This will automatically log you in just by recognising your face. Mobile phones have had this for years and it works well on PCs.

When I got it the device seemed smaller than I anticipated. I think part of that is because the screen stretches almost to the edge with only thin bezels. The two speakers are loud for listening to music and watching video. My own experience is that the battery life keeps the device going for several hours on normal use and I would expect to be able to get about 8 hours usage.

The keyboard has a backlight, if required, so you can type in low light situations. It uses USB type C charging which is becoming a bit of a standard. It's too thin for an ethernet network port but has HDMI out and USB A and what looks like a micro sd card reader. I haven't tested everything yet.

I am learning a bit of PowerShell on my PC but I also use Word, Excel, Outlook and do quite a bit of web browsing.

I am pleased with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone who has a budget below £1000 for a new laptop running Windows.

I hope my review will help shed some light about this model.
The E series means it is a business series laptop. What does that mean?
- improved rigidity of the chassis, Dell even calls it military grade.
- improved connectivity, mainly there is a dock station port on the bottom of the laptop, so you can attach it to a dock station.
- very easy to upgrade and service (take apart, add memory, change HDD etc)
- special features like a phone SIM card slot so you can have an internal 3G modem
- better quality screens with matte surface to be able to work with no reflections
- illuminated keyboard

This laptop certainly meets all the above, It does have a slot to put a SIM card in it, but you have to buy the 3G modem as an option.
The screen is matte (non-glare) so you can have a chance to work in very well lit environments and even outside.

Unfortunately, the efforts to make it thinner means Dell decided to use a non-removable battery (well, you can remove it if you take the back panel off, which is hold in place by 6 screws). The same back cover exposes the memory slots, so you can easily upgrade to 16GB by buying another 8GB module (one memory slot is empty).

The keyboard is illuminated, but has a lot of light bleed which I find a bit distracting/annoying in the dark.

The most annoying thing about this laptop is the way Dell decided to give up on the Home/End keys and make them available only if you press the Function key. That drives me nuts, common Dell, seriously?

What about the Break or Pause key? You know, press the Windows key and the Break/Pause key together and you get the System screen? Gone as well! Dell has a serious problem here, and I bet lots of professionals discarded this laptop for these keyboard issues. I am a programmer myself, and cannot really live without the End/Home keys easily available.

There is no indication on the keys whatsoever, but if you press Fn + B you get the Break key functionality... well, again, what a strange decision from Dell, to not mention this in blue letters on the B key... incredible.

The keyboard itself is not of very high quality, just like the trackpad buttons.

Other than that, not a bad laptop overall. Very quite in operation, cool most of the time (although it can get hot quickly if you run some CPU intensive software).

Compared with the older model, the E5540, the build quality is a bit lower, the plastics used are easier to scratch, but the laptop is thinner and lighter. The main involution is the keyboard, which is louder, has more light bleed in the dark and the above issues with the Home/End keys.

B003O6G5TW,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,18 November 2011,the United States,False,"First off, the single-player game is far too short and the story isn't very compelling. Neither of those issues mean that the campaign is a write-off. On the contrary, it is a fun campaign, just not one that will keep you coming back for any other reason than to enjoy the spectacular graphics. The graphics are amazing (though the consoles can't touch what this game looks like on the PC)... especially character models and movements. The AI is much more intelligent than any of the CoD campaigns I have played (and I've pretty much played them all). Both enemy and ally AI can shoot and they will both sprint and take cover when appropriate. The campaign was surprisingly difficult for me (the soldier missions), even on the Normal setting. They nailed the sound... I can't really elaborate much on that other than they got it perfect (just like GTA 4 did with the sounds of New York).

Controls are very intuitive as well. I've been a career CoD man and this was my first attempt at Battlefield. It took me a while to adjust to the control scheme in a way in which I could be as effective as I am in CoD games, but it didn't take long and, overall, I think I actually prefer the Battlefield control scheme (such as the kneel & prone control being moved to the right thumb stick and being able to perpetually sprint by holding down the left thumb stick).

I found the gameplay very impressive. It is very smooth with only the occasional frame-rate issues. Given that this game takes the Xbox to it's graphical limit based on its hardware, that's pretty good. I didn't notice any of the tearing or jaggies (poor anti-aliasing) that are common in my favorite CoD games (like Black Ops) when moving quickly around the maps... very few graphical glitches.

However, multi-player is where this game is at and where it excels. There shouldn't be any flame wars between CoD fans and Battlefield fans because the games are entirely different animals. I personally don't like EA and their marketing tactics at all. I think it was a mistake for them to use the ""CoD-killer"" moniker to start a fan war as a marketing tactic to bring attention to Battlefield 3. I can't bash them too hard though because it worked and, occasionaly, EA does put out a good game that matches the marketing hype... this is one of them.

What impressed me most about the gameplay in multi-player is that there doesn't seem to be as many lag issues that I constantly have to deal with in CoD games. Nothing bothers me more than when I'm playing Black Ops multi-player and I slip behind a wall to avoid being shot at only to be seemingly shot through the wall and when I watch the ""replay"" it appears that I was only imagining that I had taken cover behind the wall even though it was pretty clear to me... apparently, I was standing out in the open motionless, like a dummy, becoming a pin cushion for the guy who shot me. I have played about 5 hours of Battlefield multi-player and haven't once experienced that particular irritating lag issue.

The next thing that really impressed me was that old familiar feel of actual teamwork in multi-player that I hadn't experienced since the days of Halo 2 and Star Wars Battlefront. In fact, I think I can legitimately say that B3 is a perfect combination of the multi-player team matches of Halo 2 and Battlefront with a billion improvements.

The classes demand teamwork. If you choose a particular class, you aren't choosing a class without responsibilities. You are choosing a class that has an important role in gaining victory for the team, one that has particular functions that benefit the team as a whole... services that you provide the team. You aren't always making a choice of ""personal preference"" which is really the only choice when it comes to most CoD games. Many a time, I actually chose a class that was outside of my comfort zone because it seemed like a better choice to benefit the team on the particular map or for the particular game type. Not only is the game geared towards this behavior and the teamwork paradigm, it also rewards you greatly for using your class to help the team. Resuscitating your teammate will earn you points, dropping ammo or health will earn you points when your teammates use them, if you lay down cover fire to pin down an enemy while another member of your squad takes him out you earn points, if you repair another teammate's vehicle, you earn points... you get the picture. You can actually earn more points by being a team player than you can by being a lone-wolf head-hunter. In fact, the lone-wolf is most likely bound to meet an untimely end early. Abandon your squad for your own personal glory and you'll wind up dead quickly and so will your squad. You'll lose the team match and your K/D ratio will suffer.

There are hundreds of unlockables (fabulous and useful weapons and vehicle upgrades) and that are earned with the points that you accumulate through playing your class appropriately, for playing as a team, and for winning as a team as well. These unlockables are what separate Battlefield 3 from other team focused games of the past (like Battlefront) and will ensure that you will never lose interest in this multi-player game.

The vehicles in multi-player are classic as well and, like the classes themselves, promote and reward teamwork. Why go lone wolf with the tank when, by waiting for a squad member to jump in, you can double your firepower? Same with all of the vehicles. Having an adept Engineer with you can keep you in your vehicle for the whole match (if that's what's best for the team, of course).

All of that combined with the fantastic graphics and the destructible environments (yes, if you're having a hard time getting to that camper in the building across the square, smoke him out or kill him by shelling the crap out of the building... you'll notice the walls cave in and rubble crumbling to the ground below) make this a multi-player experience that you absolutely should not pass up.

CONSUMER WARNING:
With the extremely short campaign, I must say that I believe this game is way overpriced. It's simply not worth $60. I would normally suggest that one purchase it used to save some money, but the problem is that EA has joined the ever growing group of game developers and producers who are taking full advantage of online market downloads (in their obvious attempt to purge used sales). If you buy the game new, you will receive a code that gives you access to multi-player, so you'll have no worries. If you buy it used, however, you will have to pay $10 for that code no matter when you buy it used (be it now or two years from now). The game is obviously a multi-player game as the single-player campaign is too short and lackluster to be its selling point, so I find it particularly deceptive and greedy of EA to ""sell"" the only component that this game is truly worth if you happen upon a used copy. So, unless you want to wait until 2013, the only way to get your money's worth is to buy this game new... buying it used translates into an instant additional $10 no matter when you buy it, so keep that in mind. It is an expensive game and will be for quite a while. If you want the multi-player experience but you're waiting for a price drop, you may as well forget about it. Look to wholesalers like COSTCO to get it $5 cheaper than retailers (or you can sometimes find a deal here on Amazon).

******** UPDATE *********
I have now logged over 20 hours of multiplayer gameplay and the game still holds my interest as much as it did when I first wrote this review. Also, the price for the game has dropped by $20 on Amazon and at other retailers. In my opinion, that is a good price range for this game brand new (I would say anywhere between $30 - $40, at least until next year - 2012). Another thing I forgot to mention in the review is that EA hosts a web site - battlelog.battlefield.com - where you can track your statistics online, set up platoons/clans (which appears to only combine statistics and enable platoon members to communicate on the site easier... I haven't seen any platoon war offerings yet, but that doesn't mean none exist), view all weapons and their unlockables, progress with each weapon and class, next unlockables and what's needed to obtain them, etc. It's a good site and I find myself drawn to it during the day when I'm not playing the game to help me decide how I'm going to play it later.

The only complaint I have is that not enough people use their headsets in the multiplayer game. It doesn't make teamwork impossible because there are several ways you can prompt your team with objectives or by spotting enemies for them using in-game commands. It does hurt, however. Camping is not a bad thing in this game as it's obvious that when a sniper finds a good bird's nest in real life, what does he do? He camps. When soldiers are defending a position, what do they do? They camp. Camping can feel more like a problem where there is a lack of communication, though, and will naturally result in more unnecessary team casualties. Like I said, there are work arounds, but because too many people go without the headsets, you'll suffer more team deaths than you normally would and at times it can become costly. The game is fun regardless, but if you want to avoid this tragedy, hook up with some friends when you play this game and/or add friends that you play with randomly who do use their headsets so that you'll have a solid corp of friends available to play at any time. What I can't understand is that those who play CoD games seem to use their headsets more frequently even when they don't need to (since teamwork is not that important)... but I suppose it's mostly to be able to rub it in when they take someone down.

B003O6G5TW,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,26 October 2011,the United States,False,"I will try to make my review as unbiased as possible, firstly there is no way to review this game without comparing it to a different fps so for reviewing purposes obviously we will be comparing it to call of duty. I've owned and xbox 360 since 2007, just recently got a ps3. I've played call of duty since call of duty 3 while really playing competitively since call of duty 4, I've messed around with people who play in actual tournaments like MLG and such which is cool because that should tell you I spend more time killing people than respawning or getting mad because I die. Having said that call of duty was great for when it was original and there was nothing like it that could come even close to being able to provide such fun and endless hours of frustration and excitement, there simply wasn't. The last few years the call of duty franchise obviously has become more mainstream and appealing to a wider audience therefore it sells millions and millions of copies every year even though it is the same game just rebranded with a new name and a few ""features"" that keeps it ""new"". I did not know about the battlefield series until I played bad company 1 on 360, at the time I thought it was a joke, I found the controls and gameplay to be so foreign from what I was used to (call of duty) that I did not enjoy playing it at all. The battlefield series since has made GIGANTIC leaps and has not dissapointed in providing a bigger badder better product than their predecessor. Battlefield 3 is not an exception to this rule. DICE and EA have produced a masterpiece, graphics, gameplay, overall presentation of the game is polished, yes you have to install the HD texture pack, yes there are two discs, one for multiplayer and one for singleplayer, seriously I only play multiplayer so that singleplayer disc will be picking up some dust and might see the light of day when I decide I want some achievements. Battlefield 3 does an awesome job to create a more realistic environment of war that call of duty fails to do, the weapon sounds and the effect it has on objects such as walls and hesco barriers are like no other and the lighting and detail on environmental features such as bushes and brushes are all top class. People do not enjoy this game because it is a totally different style of play than call of duty. This game is team based and you must work to support your team while denying the other team to do so. bullet drop from sniper shots is also something that makes the game stand out as supposed to the quick scoping done on call of duty. Battlefield 3 is a true representation of what a fps really is, the ability to blow down walls to make new entry points so that you can reach your objective, the vehicle selection that is available for you to use to help you overtake the enemy position, now I've only played about 3 hours of multiplayer on battlefield 3 last night and had no issues with lag or getting kicked from servers, I did have issues finding the game at first but I quickly figured out you can search for servers by number of players and jump in a server that only has 3 players in the lobby, by the time you hit join server, the server will be full therefore the people searching for a random server receive those errors, and that just means a LOT of people are playing the game therefore should not hinder the game's rating like a lot of people have done. Most of the negative reviews that have been made you can read and see that the person reviewing has a distinct love for call of duty and do not enjoy anything other than that game which is fine, this game is not call of duty, does that make it a bad game? no it certainly does not, battlefield 3 has everything that I enjoy in a fps minus all the little angry 12 year old thugs who think they are the best at everything and honestly I am glad these kids enjoy playing call of duty because that just means I do not have to listen or play with them and that makes battlefield 3 even that much better.

B0B4T2V1VN,Adam,2.0,Faulty units,24 October 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"I purchased 2 of these. Bought them at a reduced price.

Both of them came with flaws:

• IPS backlight bleeding
• IPS glow
• faulty touchpad

Amazon replaced one of them, but refused to replace another one. They said they already provided a replacement. Though it is 2 separate orders. They just hang up the phone.

Be aware, by purchasing this laptop from Amazon, it will be on you to deal with hardware issues. Whether you’re a Prime member as I am (I was) or not. They juggling prices. If you get it cheaper, all they will offer you is a refund. Also, you’ll be blacklisted by the customer support team if you try to persist for replacement.

B08SJNPG9H,Gabriella,5.0,An Incredible Laptop!,18 October 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"I don't often take the time to write reviews but I felt this product deserved it.

Firstly, while yes, this laptop is American and not UK, I don't feel this is a big deal. It was so easy to simply change the language setting from start-up to English (UK). Unless you need to look at every key you type, it shouldn't be a reason not to get this laptop.

The box did arrive a bit worse for wear. It came in an exterior brown box which at least absorbed some of the impact. Having said that, the box isn't the important part, and it served its purpose of protecting the contents inside. The laptop was in perfect condition.

I've had this laptop nearly 2 weeks now, and what with being busy with various life things, I haven't had chance to fully experience what it has to offer. What I will say though, is there was a game I stopped playing over a year ago due to my very old laptop just not being able to keep up with it. Even on the lowest settings it just lagged too much. I went back to it on this laptop and I couldn't believe how well it worked! It was no problem at all for this machine.

The Link to MyAsus was a thing I never knew I needed. Just for this review, I was able to effortlessly take pictures on my phone and have them on my laptop without having to deal with plugging cables in, or sending files over email. just a simple link from a mobile app to a laptop and it was done. Also, I feel it solves the problem of this laptop having no webcam, as you can use your phones camera.

Finally, this is just a beautiful laptop, I've never had one this nice before. I'm glad I listened to the amazing reviews this got and bought it. And if you decide to buy it too, you won't be disappointed!

B08SJNPG9H,Lukas,3.0,Ok laptop,19 June 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"I bought this back in 2021 for £2000'ish. Died on me 4 days ago.

I've had several issues with it. It would randomly stutter around once a day for 3 seconds, destroying it's fps. That would happen regardless of what I was doing on it, be it gaming, watching videos or being idle on desktop.

It also kept freezing randomly whether it was idle or in use, leaving you only with the option to force shutdown. Later the issue also spread to it's bootup, which eventually lead to it freezing 90% of the time I tried to boot it up. I tried to nuke it, but it kept freezing during windows installation aswell.

However, the couple of years I've had it, it's been a powerhouse. It destroyed any game on ultra settings with minimal heat in it's early years.

To be honest, for it's current going price I'd look for another machine. Grab it if it's on sale for less than £2000. It's specs are outdated by today's standards for it's asking price.",0
B08SJNPG9H,Conor,1.0,Do NOT buy Asus laptops.,17 December 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"Please, don't make my mistake. I know it's tempting to ignore reviews like this.

Asus RMA procedures are basically scams. My laptop was defective, screen went gray and then turned off. I sent it for repair. Thought it'd be simple fix.

No. They said the LCD connection (Internal connection) was damaged by customer induced force. They are currently trying to charge me the price of the laptop again to get it fixed and sent back to me.

-theres no way for me to have done the damage. It's clearly a faulty connection. But they don't listen. I've explained it several times by email and they respond with the same thing. Saying the LCD connection is damaged by customer. They include a picture on the RMA page and there doesn't appear to be any physically visable damage on the connection they're talking about. -Clearly just faulty.

But hey, they're a big company and if they can get away with charging you twice for an expensive laptop they'll do it.

Please, I used to recommend Asus to people. Don't do it. It's not worth it. Other gaming companies have much better, honest customer support.

Don't do this to yourself.

B08SJNPG9H,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,19 November 2021,Mexico,False,"Es un equipazo, de eso no cabe duda. Obviamente comercializarla con 32GB de RAM en lugar de 16 hubiera sido mucho mejor. De cualquier forma...

Pros:
La pantalla es genial, nitiza, buen color, hasta para diseño se puede usar.
La RAM es poca pero basta y es rapida.
El teclado es un sueño, configuracion reactiva tecla por tecla con patrones y duracion... si te gusta el RGB, este teclado es de otro mundo. Tambien es comodo para escribir mucho (soy programador).
La bateria dura hasta 6 horas con todo y el teclado encendido!!!!!!!!!!! obvio no jugando, en un perfil equilibrado, pero es mucho tiempo para un equipo de estos y me parecio genial, ademas de que se carga muy rapido... 50 - 70 min.
Silenciosa aun en modo degenerado.
La RTX3070 es de ensueño, nunca habia podido correr un juego day one en ultra a mas de 60fps. Probado con el Forza 5 (no se, el que es de Mexico) y en baja da hasta 400fps y aun asi se ve genial y en ultra da de 60 a 70... Doom Eternal en modo degenerado da los 60 estables y hasta el marauder sale bailando, ahora si no te pierdes de nada de accion, ah y en modo ray tracing.
El sonido es muy bueno, tiene el mejor volumen de las laptop que he tenido (MSI Apache, Alienware M15 y Asus G17 (2015 creo).

Cons:
No he notado ninguna diferencia entre el Ryzen 9 y el i7 que tenia antes. Ni en mi scripts de hashing, ni en compilacion de codigo, ni en multithreading. Practicamente tengo el mismo CPU.
16 de RAM es un insulto para este equipo.
Conectar y desconectar el cargador provoca que se cambie el perfil de rendimiento (es configurable) pero el problema es que la pantalla parpadea hasta 3 veces y es molesto aunque no realmente un problema.
El pad tactil se atonta de vez en cuando y no hace clic... no estoy seguro que sea una falla de hardware.
En el borde de la pantalla tiene un filo de un marco que si llega a topar con algo se me hace que lo dobla facil... es complicado de explicar pero hay que tratarla con cuidado.
No tiene camara.
El wifi es malo, muuuuuuuy malo. Tengo un Meraki MX67W, sin problemas en alguno de los otros equipos y este derrepente se desconecta. Tambien lo probé con un MX100 y con un Mesh Deco de TP Link.

En general es un buen equipo, lo volveria a comprar y si los problemas persisten... un reset y vemos como va. De entrada, recomendado.

UPDATE

Le puse 32GB de RAM Crucial de 3200Mhz y un Kingston SSD NV1 2000GB M.2 NVMe PCIe Gen 3.0... resultó en la mejor laptop que he tenido. Ya jubilé mi equipo de escritorio y la uso para todo.

Lo unico que no puedo hacer es conectar el Oculus Quest 2 a esta laptop porque bajo ninguna configuracion agarra la RTX. Ni por OculusLink ni por AirLink. Pero no me importa, el equipo funciona genial.

B08SJNPG9H,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,15 June 2022,the United States,False,"I am not a gamer. I bought this laptop to do small sample size deep learning training for transformer language models. I use cloud GPU and TPU for the main training with full sample size. But I really wanted to have something locally to run fine tuning and debugging with smaller sample sizes. I was OK just using the cloud for image deep learning, but language models get truly huge! I haven’t trained anything yet, but I’m really excited to test it out. NVIDIA RTX 3070 or 3070 Ti seems to be the sweet spot for a reasonable cost vs performance in June 2022. I also though about a desktop, but got tired of waiting for GPU prices for desktops to come down. One thing I was concerned about was the screen being FHD and not QHD and brightness only 300 nits. But the quality is excellent anyway and colors pop for Netflix and video watching. Pixels can be seen, but images are still very smooth. QHD will be better, but it cost $600 more for a similar laptop. Fan noise, heat, were pleasant surprise when running office type tasks. CPU temp was 50 C, body was luke warm, and fan was silent. Track pad is very smooth. Keys are springy and comfortable and not too loud. Audio is excellent too. Speakers are good quality on music and very loud. Headphone jack output is of high quality and can drive all of your best music. Blue tooth headphone paired easily and sounds OK. Not as good as plugged-in using high quality headset, obviously, but same as usual. This will also make a good media watching device since the screen quality and audio is so nice. Note, there is NO videocam. Can’t do video calling without a plug-in video camera. I already have a USB video cam, but just a reminder. There is a built-in microphone for voice commands, dictation, Cortana. It seems to be a good quality. It pickec up my voice no problem and sounded clear.

Update: I trained 200 epoch transformer language model, text generation task (Francois Cholet, 2nd ed, chapter 12 part 1). It took half the time per epoch as free tier Google Colab GPU. I thought it will be slower, maybe take 50-100% longer per epoch. Was pleasantly surprised. Now I can run all Colab free tier GPU/TPU training on my laptop locally, which is much easier than moving large data and model files around. Also I hate editing Jupyter notebook directly on Colab, which can seriously lag when a lot of people are using their services. CPU temps are 85C and GPU temps are 75C during training. I lifted that back up by 2"" to help with air flow. I can use manual mode to up the fan to 100% and I can keep it 5% coller during heavy training on GPU/CPU. For light tasks, CPU is 65C and GPU os 0. Fan speed ""Windows"" seem to keep things quiet and cool at the same time for light tasks.

B07KF1TC9T,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,17 July 2019,the United States,False,"This Chromebook is outstanding - perfect reminder of what a Chromebook should be (cheap, long battery, zippy web browsing, worry free usage, optimized port selection). The size is right, the keys feel great, the track pad is fine. The screen resolution is perfect for a Chromebook. I like how well this thing keeps a charge, and charges quickly. USB-C can't be beat, and it still has a headphone jack, HDMI, regular USB and a slot for SD cards. If you're in the market for a Chromebook, you can't do much better especially for the price. The previous Lenovo Chromebook I had is still kicking - I can't believe how much value I get out of a sub-$180 laptop. Just wanted something a little bigger than the 11"" Chromebook I already had. Perfect for traveling.

Keep in mind:
- Not a PC or a Mac (if that is really truly what you think you want or need, look elsewhere and expect to spend 3x)
- Do you research about what a Chromebook actually is. All you 1, 2, and 3 star reviewers complaining that its not a PC or Macbook look like goobers in your reviews. It's essentially a web-browser, which for most people is all you need (Facebook, Netflix, look at memes, email, pay bills online, etc.). You can even use the browser version of the Microsoft suite if you're feeling in the mood to do some work.
- Even if the price was 2x, you can't complain about the screen resolution, or the hard drive size, or the lack of back-lit keyboard.
- Plenty of RAM for what you intend to do on a Chromebook
- Not a touch-screen. Don't be surprised.

Things I'd like to see improved:
- Give me an 8GB RAM option just for kicks. 4 is fine, but RAM is cheap these days.
- Flush-mount SD Card slot

B00GZ1GV3I,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 March 2014,the United States,False,"I'm in my last semester (hopefully) of my undergrad and my 4 year old HP Envy quit on me in the first week of this semester. I've had my Chromebook for about a month now, so I think I'm a little qualified to leave a pretty accurate review.

Overall, I absolutely love my Chromebook. It is an amazing little device and I will probably never go back to a PC (I'm not a Mac person at all so I can't compare it to them). Now, as a disclaimer, I am not someone who does online gaming or software video editing. At most, I'll edit some pictures and maybe edit some music files, so I cannot attest to this devices ability to fulfill those needs (though it doesn't seem like it would be very compatible with them). However, as someone who needs a computer mostly for internet, research, email, music, social networking, and document editing, this thing is amazing.

PROS
1. Speed. This thing is a beast. It comes out of a sleep faster than my Kindle will start up (if I shut it down, not just if I wake it up from sleeping). It's kind of incredible how fast it boots. Internet browsing and document editing is awesome, video viewing is great (YES, this OS IS great for Netflix and online streaming, don't believe what you've heard if it is contrary to what I just said).

2. Display. I really like the Chrome OS layout (it's pretty similar to Windows 7, which I liked a lot more than any devices with Windows 8 that I've tried--my phone has Windows 8 and I kind of hate it now that I have my Chromebook). It's intuitive and simple--the whole setup process for me took like ten minutes tops.

3. Sync with Google. I can access all of my stuff EVERYWHERE. I used Google Drive before, but not as heavily. It is soooo so nice to have all of your material on whatever computer you may have access to.

4. Apps. Google has come out with some really useful apps for these devices and they're only making more.

5. Hardware. I love the way this Acer laptop is set up. The sound is surprisingly wonderful for such a small machine, AND it has separate ""speakers' and ""headphones"" settings for sound. No more plugging my headphones in, forgetting I had the volume cranked earlier that day, and having my ear drums blown out. It's a simple but beautiful thing and I don't know why more manufacturers don't do it. The top row of keys is as follows: Escape, Back (internet browser button), Forward, Refresh, Fullscreen, I don't know what to call the next button but if you hit it it brings all the things you have open up on your desktop screen and you can click on what you want to go to, Dimmer, Brighter, Mute, Volume Down, Volume Up, Power. The ""programs"" button is awesome, I use it all the time to get to something else that I have open but don't want to scroll through everything to find, and having the internet back, forward, and refresh buttons on the keyboard is surprisingly nice. Some people say they're worried about hitting the power button accidentally, but to turn it off you have to hold it for a few seconds, so it's difficult to do it by accident. The screen is matte, so you can still see things if you're outside or by a window, and the trackpad is awesome--two finger scroll, click with two fingers for a right click, and you can enable tap to click in the settings (which I was thrilled with because I hate pushing down every time). Unfortunately, though, there's no zoom feature on the trackpad. That's my only complaint about it. This thing is SO lightweight overall--with my old computer, if I lugged it around campus my shoulders would kill me, but with this one I can barely tell it's in my backpack.

6. Sleep/Occasional Crash Recovery. Any time I've put this to sleep, turned it off without closing things, or had it run out of memory and need to restart abruptly, I have not lost a single thing. Are crashes desirable? No. Do they happen? Yes. Does this thing deal with them well? Absolutely. On a computer with only 2 gb of RAM I kind of expected a few crashes because I can be a heavy internet browser, but when it restores itself, all my tabs come back and whatever I was working on is safe.

7. Battery Life. Battery life battery life oh my gosh battery life. I am AMAZED with it. One day I was using it to watch Netflix and bum around on the internet and the battery was at about 60% and I didn't have to plug it in for FIVE hours. On a full charge, it will do at least 8 if you're not watching videos, and about 6 or 7 if you are. It's absolutely incredible and if it's the one reason you buy this computer, I wouldn't judge that decision (other than to say it's totally reasonable). It's wonderful and cannot be matched. It's also super convenient when I need to take it to class and am not sitting close to a power outlet. My old HP would get 3 hours MAX when the batter was new. If this computer only lasted 3 hours, I would wonder what was wrong with it. The lack of a need to plug in is a beautiful, beautiful thing and it is definitely unparalleled.

8. Google Docs. At first I was worried about not having Microsoft Word, but honestly, Google's line of word processing programs are so similar that it doesn't even matter. You can save things as .docx or .pdf and then anyone can view them in the ""traditional"" format. It's absolutely not necessary to have Microsoft Word. Plus, there are plenty of converter apps that Google has to view things from other people and turn them into Google Docs so you can edit them, and then turn them back into pdfs or whatever you need.

CONS

1. Sometimes it crashes. It happens with all computers. However, as I said, it reboots well and I've never lost anything.

2. The fact that all my stuff is on the cloud... I'm a little uncomfortable with it. I have an external hard drive with most of my files on it (especially videos and stuff). I've never had any problems with hacking, but it worries me slightly. However, Google is constantly improving security, so I'm not ALL that worried. The nice thing is that you can set up ""2 Step Verification,"" so when you (or potentially someone else) log into your google account from a previously unused computer, you have to supply your password AND google sends your phone a text with a code to put in. You have to have your phone to log in, but this gives me a little more peace of mind.

3. Desire to Learn (this online software that my school uses for virtually everything) issues. The dropbox on Desire to Learn won't let me upload files. This has been an absolute pain and I have to make sure that I either have my Kindle Fire charged so I can send PDFs to it and then upload them with that, or that I'm on campus so I can use a public computer to turn in my assignment. This is my biggest complaint and I hope I can resolve it eventually, though I don't know how I could do it on my own.

4. Printing. I haven't sat down yet to try to connect my printer to cloud print. I know there are directions, I know you are supposed to be able to print with Chromebooks, but there are so many extra steps that I just haven't bothered with it yet. I've resorted to printing on my campus and my printer has gone dormant. Maybe eventually I'll hook it up and change this to a pro, but for now, it's a hindrance.

5. File Explorer. The file explorer is pretty simple but is sometimes kind of glitchy. Usually if I put my computer to sleep and wake it up again it solves that problem, but it's annoying nonetheless.

FINAL VERDICT
Overall, if you're not a huge gamer or video editor, this computer is amazing. All these great features combined with the outstanding price make it a fantastic choice for those who just use computers for internet and document editing. Contrary to Microsoft's Chrome OS slam commercials, IT IS NOT USELESS WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION. No, you can't access websites, but you can't do that offline with a PC anyway. You can still make documents and they'll just save to your small hard drive and sync with Google Drive later. It saves the most recent things you've worked on, and if you want more you can use an external hard drive or flash drive (or physically move files to the offline drive) to access more files offline. Honestly, though, I'm so rarely without an internet connection that it doesn't even matter anyway.
I would recommend this computer wholeheartedly (and have many times in the past month). It's compact, intuitive, useful, and does almost everything a common PC will do. If you have any other questions that I didn't address, just ask :)

B00GZ1GV3I,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,6 March 2014,the United States,False,"just got this today-- a day early as a matter of fact... i switched from a samsung chromebook to this acer and serioiusly: because i had everything backed up to the cloud, i was able to clean the old one (i'm giving it to my daughter) and set this one up in about five minutes total... beautiful machine... lots more appealing that the two macbook airs i used to have...

in fact i quit itunes altogether and simply stream music... i've also been working in google docs lately and find hardly any difference between it and microsoft or apple... in fact this machine can do what i need (write, spreadsheets, presentations) and some of the newer apps i need to explore... there shouldn't be any complaints about this machine, except from tech nerds who think that this isnt's ""strong enough"" or ""fast enough""... it rawks... i got the 32 GB version which will be way more than i need but if you do have music, movies, etc. you should have no problem w/it as it comes w/a SSD memory card slot (like my samsung) and a new usb 3.0 port that i can get 64GB or 128GB sticks for that download faster than anything on a 2.0, which it also has...

and about the comment above about it being better than the macbook air-- so true, it's exactly like a macbook air, just faster and more stable (chrome OS, that is).... keypad is great, screen is great, size is perfect, weight is perfect... what more can i say?

and it's all true what you've heard-- right out of the box, w/in five minutes i am online and working on something i was working on last night (because it was in the cloud)...

and if you're worried about having to be online all the time for it to work, i ask you this-- when are you ever w/out access to the internet? i mean seriously come on.. if anyone is that worried about this machine not having 3g or 4g then they need to get w/their carrier and add tethering to their phones because i have the tethering option and have only used it once... and printing is a breeze; i mean, how many printers out there are already internet or google print ready? i saw a printer just the other day for less than $60...

and the fact that you'll never have to worry about upgrades, viruses, etc... all automatic... and when i set it up, there they were: all my apps and bookmarks ready to go... i can't wait to have it charged completely so i can see if the battery does in fact, last 6.5 hours...

so much more than a simple netbook, and because it's google, everything works across all of my platforms-- my nexus 7 as well as my nexus 5...

great value, great looking machine, great working machine... get one of these things, you won't be disappointed.

03/15/2014 update:

nothing bad at all, in fact still runs and works like a dream... but i have read a couple of gripes regarding the SSD Card hanging out about 1/3'... yes it does do that; unlike my Samsung which fit to at least 1/4"", but really hasn't gotten in the way of anything: mostly i use an SSD card or micro SSD card w/an adapter and when i give over my micro SSD to a friend i just give him the USB adapter and use it... there are so many ways to do it to your liking... i have yet to get anything transferred from a USB 3.0 because no one i have owns a machine w/one, but i certainly will once my friend who has all the new movies finishes his new desktop tower build. that's all... keep having fun... oh yes-- wanted to mention that my camera is a DSLR Sony alpha model and w/all the photo apps out there, there's no way to make a bad photo, even w/my little point-and-shoot... just plug and play, everything basic sets itself up, you can do the customization.

B09WMTTRP5,Raffi,2.0,The laptop crashes on every possible game,7 January 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"I bought an MSI laptop because the brand is known for its high quality products. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.

The laptop crashes on every possible game, even the 10 year old ones cause problems. Photoshop barely runs. Contacting the manufacturer yielded no results - answers were evasive and vague. I'm not sure the laptop passes sufficient quality control.

The laptop performs poorly with Windows 11. Updates cause huge problems such as system hangs and even crashes. In addition, the laptop is not designed for quick upgrades. Components such as the drive and ram are locked with the warranty seal.

On the positive side, the keyboard should be mentioned, which is comfortable to use. The camera lock and fingerprint reader also work well.

In conclusion, I would not recommend this laptop. It is a low-quality product that does not meet basic requirements. I will not be choosing hardware from this brand in the future. It's a waste of money.

B0CMRJF3FK,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,19 September 2024,the United States,False,"This laptop is on the heavier side compared to most & my older laptop. However that doesn't really bother me as I use it to VJ with. I enjoy the feeling as if it can take the mobile VJ world.

The video card has handle everything I believe I would put it through doing a gig. I ran it off of 4 monitors without any issues. From running Video on 1 screen, VJ software on another & down loading & putting files in their folder all simultaneously.

This until is loud when cooling itself which won't concern me as the music will drown out any noise that could be made. Although loud it does an excellent job at cooling down to a normal operating temp. All my settings are set for gaming as opposed to the other to settings 2 settings available balanced & eco.

I really like the predator software to help manage settings. At the push of the predator button it pops up & you can change settings instantaneously. You will have to restart for settings to take effect but at least You don't have to go into your bios to change settings, which is what I had to do with my last unit.

I bought this laptop ""like new"" and paid just over $900 but even at just over $1200 I think its an excellent value for the money. The battery life isn't much of a concern either as I set my batter settings to charge only to 85% as I want to preserve my battery & I wouldn't VJ on just battery anyways. The screen has vibrant color as I watch videos on the screen.

I'm really happy with this purchase & would recommend this laptop to any of my VJ, DJ & KJ friends. As far you games I sure my software doesn't put this until through the riggers the top games would so I can't really help you there.

Hopefully this help someone make a informed decision on this being the laptop for them.

P.S. Oh, gave it just 4 stars because I had to replace memory as I was getting the BSOD but once that was done, unit as run as smooth as butter. Remember I did buy the ""like new"" so I expected something to go amiss & I'd have to replace it.

All you'll need is a base with or without cooling so it doesn't heat up. I had it waiting at the office for 20 minutes and it had reached 55 degrees, with no game running, just internet explorer. But once I had it back up for about 10 minutes it had reached 42°C to 45°C in silent mode, which means a base needs it. Like all laptops anyway. It's not just the temperature, but keeping it clean from the inside as well. I have been using it for five days and I am very satisfied with its speed. I am also very satisfied with the seller for his very fast shipping. I had received it on the third day after ordering.

For the price point $589, this Dell laptop is really good and an excellent value!
One thing to be aware of!! When I received the LT one of the first things I did is verify the specs. and actual LT hardware, then I checked out the warranty. As it turns out Amazon consciously left out any mention of warranty (I assumed wrongly that this was simply a misnomer on Amazon's part, bad assumption). As it turns out the warranty clock started when the LT was delivered to the retail distributor (not Amazon but a third party (busylittlebee)). This means that there was only 4 months remaining on the warranty (originally 14 mo. warranty). I was pissed!!!!!! According to Dell's records, this LT was sold to Best Buy, so I don't understand how ""busylittlebee"" became the distributor?? Anyway, Dell is a good company and I contacted them, sent them my Amazon Invoice and Dell extended my warranty from the date I purchased the LT to 12 months!! Prior to contacting Dell about the warranty issue I contacted Amazon and Amazon's response was ""return it"" with an attitude.

The LT includes 32GB of RAM which is just right when you have a LT with a touch screen. The larger RAM helps make the touch screen perform better! The huge SSD 1TB is overkill (in my opinion) but no harm. I will not be using this LT for gaming so I did not rate it for this use, primarily being used for multirotor RC devices, recording Drum Covers, misc. other tasks. Others have complained about the display brightness.
I took it outside on a sunny day and tested it since this is the environment I will use it when flying my multirotor RC craft. I found the display to be acceptable, readable in sunlight (although there is some glare from the touchscreen), but still the display is adequate when used in full sun outside. The touch screen is very handy when Recording Drum Covers. I use a high performance DT computer for most tasks.

B09BG841VC,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,30 May 2022,the United States,False,Mainly bought this for online classes and to run data analysis software on it. Works great! Screen is a little on the cheaper side (its one of those screens you have to tilt back to get a decent viewing angle) but its not really a concern for the purpose i use it for. I purchased the 17in model so the screen is large and works great with multiple open windows. Keyboard feels a little weird not much travel to the keys but again not a big concern. Don’t really game on it but I did download a few STEAM games and they worked and ran great. The processor handles them no problem. Mine came with WINDOWS 11 which I have grown to like (great multi-tasking features!) I think it’s a great mid-range laptop that’s great for students and office work. Might be a good choice for casual/amateur gamers that want to get into gaming without paying $1200+ but definitely invest in a keyboard and mouse if you’re trying to be serious about your gaming.

B07C3213NM,Jonathan Pie,3.0,OVERPRICED! Do not pay over 1100GBP for i7-8550U + HD 620 version,8 July 2018,the United Kingdom,False,"ATTENTION!
If you need more CPU+GPU performance such as the Dell XPS 15 9570 (2018), you should wait for the Lenovo ThinkPad P1 that will feature much stronger hardware.

MODEL: Lenovo ThinkPad 480 (2018 normal version), i7-8550U, Intel HD 620
PRICE: 1285 EUR
DATE OF PURCHASE: 7 July 2018

SUITABLE FOR:
- people who write a lot on their laptops (emails, articles, blogs, marketing, media, etc.)
- hobby photographers (e.g. Photoshop, Lightroom, GIMP) who work with calibrated external monitors and do not use the laptop display for colour accurate tasks

PROs
+ on average 40% faster than previous 7th generation i7-7500U processor
+ the best laptop keyboard you can find on the market (only rivals with similarly excellent keyboards are Dell Alienware 13 R3, Microsoft Surface Book 2 15"" and Dell Latitude 7490)
+ integrated Intel HD 620 powerful enough for YouTube 1440p (2560x1440p) videos
+ full size SD card reader
+ usually very quiet fans
+ Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 docking station digitally connects 2 external monitors with up to 4K 2160p resolution, and it makes the laptop more comfortable to type on because it increases the tilt
+ fully matte display and chassis, so there are zero distracting reflections
+ keyboard can be swapped to different languages within seconds
+ RAM, SSD/HDD can be easily accessed and swapped
+ up to 32GB RAM (2x 16GB)
+ keyboard and palmrest areas are relatively cool even under heavy load
+ fan exhaust and USB Type C (Thunderbolt 3 with 4x PCIe lanes) are on the left side, so you can use a mouse without any issues or cable interference on the right side
+ 2 types of chargers available: 65Watt fast charger and 45Watt slim for travelling
I recommend getting both: one for your home and one for travelling
+ 2 types of batteries available: slim standard or larger one
I prefer the slim type because I do not really use the laptop without power so much
+ charging is done with USB Type C with can deliver up to 100Watt, but the chargers do not provide more than 65Watt
+ The version with Nvidia MX150, 2GB can provide around 10% faster works with image processing or very light gaming with reduced graphics

CONs
- thermal throttling due to weak cooling system
Workaround: you can use Intel XTU (Extreme Tuning Utility) to undervolt the CPU and GPU. This will permanently extend battery life, reduce the fan noise and increase the performance by around 15% without making the system unstable.
- slow internal SSD
- M.2 slot only provides half the maximum PCIe speed, so you have a 50% storage bottleneck
- almost impossible to find the model with 13% faster i7-8650U processor
- very outdated and ugly thick bezels that are thicker than my door frames
- insultingly bad TN display, and even IPS version is quite poor
- slow SD card reader
- webcam with 720p resolution and shockingly bad video and audio quality - useless for conferences or webcasts
- terrible speakers
- very thick and takes more space (volume) than the 15.6"" Dell XPS 15 9570 (2018, i7-8750H + Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti Max-Q)
- fingerprint scanner is not integrated in the
- arrow keys slightly small
- only 1 drive (either one M.2 NVMe/SSD, one 2.5"" 7mm SSD or one 2.5"" 7mm HDD)
- internal Intel HD 620 has ok performance for 720p, and dedicated Nvidia MX150 provides ok performance for 1080p video

:: ThinkPad Keyboards ::
I need to write a bit more about this because it is the main reason why I use ThinkPad laptops at home (T480) and at work (T450). Without this outstandingly excellent keyboard, there is no reason to buy Lenovo ThinkPads.

PROs ThinkPad keyboard
+ 1.8mm key travel feels fantastic
+ great dampening
+ very comfortable feel of the key strokes
+ very quiet, fast and accurate typing experience
+ large, clear letters that do not fade thanks to laser engraving
+ easy to read even for elderly people
+ anywhere you touch the keys, they are reliable and responsive
+ fantastic grip of the keys thanks to their smile shape with concave design - it is a dream to type on ThinkPad keyboards
+ letters are positioned on the top left, so you can add special character stickers to the keyboard without any issues
+ nice, accurate trackpad with red dot ""joystick"" and extra mouse buttons above trackpad

CONs ThinkPad keyboard
- Ctrl and Fn keys are swapped, and it took me about 2 years to get used to this, and I still dislike it. You can swap the keys in the BIOS or via the (slow) Lenovo software, but even then it feels unnatural because the keys have different sizes.
- IdeaPad and Yoga keyboards are quite low quality and uncomfortable compared to ThinkPad keyboards
- all 15.6"" Lenovo ThinkPads come with a very unergonomic and uncomfortable number pad. This results in a de-centered keyboard, and my neck hurts after typing for hours because it twists my hands.
- small arrow keys
- keyboard does not remember the LED backlight settings, so you need to manually enable them after every restart

The memory was more than enough, although if you were doing graphics or art etc, you may need more memory space.

B074N5C4Q6,WeeMan71,4.0,Awesome product at a bargain price with one major flaw,6 July 2019,the United Kingdom,False,"This review is in two parts - if you just want to know what I thought of the product then just read the first part. If you are interested in what happened AFTER I started it up to avoid having the same issues then also read part two.

Part One
I searched high and low for a laptop at a reasonable price with a good specification to serve as my second device when travelling with work. I have an iPad Pro but there are just some things in the Windows world that they don't do so well which finally got to the point where I decided I needed a new windows laptop.

I had written off the Microsoft laptops due to them being too expensive then came across this one on Amazon. Not only is it an absolute bargain with over £200 off the list price but it performs perfectly and is on par with a MacBook in terms of being pleasing to own and use.

Yes it's a first generation but after reading reviews and based on my needs which are email, productivity apps and browsing, I decided it would be more than adequate for my needs. And I was absolutely right - it is. Yes ports are limited and yes it came with 10S but that can easily (for free) be upgraded to full Windows 10 if needed. Would I recommend - at this price absolutely.

Part two
It wasn't all plain sailing though. After unboxing and setting up the laptop I left it to run the various updates while I carried on working on my desktop. When I turned back to it and hit the keypad I was told that Windows Hello was not able to log me in and ""Your pin is no longer available due to a change to the security settings on this device. You can set up your pin again by going to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options."" Cue panic as there was no way past this without either Hello or a pin, neither of which were working.

After much browsing I discovered an update last year (2018) had caused this issue so I wasn't alone. However, the only fix was to recover the laptop which was what I decided to do rather than send it back or call anyone. Note you need at least a 16GB external drive to do this if you get to this point too.

After the first recovery and again getting through the initial set up I thought I would lock the machine to see if the issue still existed which would suggest it was running an OS that had the update causing the issue but nothing afterwards which included a fix. Upon trying to unlock I was back with the same message about security settings so then had a good idea what to do next.

I did a second recovery boot and then set up the machine for the third time. However, once into the desktop I changed lock and sleep settings to 'Never' and turned off Hello. I let all updates run, during which time I also switched out of 10S to Pro which was almost instant (I expected a load of install options). After updates had completed all that was left was to reboot which I did with fingers crossed that it wasn't going to be another Groundhog Day. This time I was presented with the option to enter my pin which I did and I was in with everything working fine. Then I set up and enabled Hello and locked the device again. This time Hello switched in and unlocked and hey presto a fully functioning W10 Surface laptop. It had taken me around 10 hours from start to finish to get everything sorted.

A final word of warning is that when you enable Hello in settings there is a message saying that ""windows hello is preventing some options from being displayed"" which is in red and seems like a warning that something is wrong. I googled it and it seems to have caused panic but it's basically saying that when Hello is working it will kick in every time the device is locked and you can't set a timer to delay it. I have no idea why it's in red or why Microsoft didn't just say what I just said!

If you got this far then well done and just be aware of how to avoid the recovery route that I went down.

Also, the battery life is amazing! I've brought it for an afternoon work at a cafe without its charging cable and felt certain that it wouldn't be a problem (it wasn't, six hours is well within comfortable range of what this battery is capable of, at least using the set up I do).",0
B01CVKKZ60,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,10 January 2017,Canada,False,"We bought this for our daughter, as she is increasingly competing for time on the Macbook and my wife isn't eager to give that up. We wanted something affordable, but rugged. I waited for Black Friday specials, but nothing came up that was worth the effort to wait in line somewhere, so when this went on sale before Christmas it was a gimme.
My daughter loves it. The screen is decent and the size of the device works well for her. It is quite compact. It has a built in carry handle which makes it easy to tote around. This hinges seem well built. I like the fact that the keyboard is spill proof too. The specs are not dazzling, however with 4GB of RAM, it does't feel slow. She mainly uses it for YouTube and Netflix, but as her student needs increase, having access to Google Docs will be key. The hard drive is entry level with only 16GB. This again isn't a deal breaker at this point without the ability to install anything. There is the option of an SD Card which I might invest if in Google Play does eventually come. The speakers are adequate and the touchpad is quite good for the price point.
We did try to enable the Canary build of ChromeOS to get early access to the Google Play Store. It was easy enough to do, however it did not successfully enable the Play Store and it was indeed rather unstable. We will wait it out for the Play Store to be part of the ChromeOS stable build down the road. We also thought about spending more on a fancier Chromebook with a touchscreen. Unfortunately this comes at quite a premium and I don't get the sense that she is missing anything.
All in all, unless you need a bigger screen or really feel the need for a touch screen, this is a great little 'laptop', with the limitations that ChromeOS present. For those used to a Windows laptop, this may be difficult to adjust to. The beauty is there are no risks of a virus or problems with OS reinstalls like when you use Windows. If you have any problem, a simple reboot and your Chromebook is fresh again. The only downfall is the limited offline functionality, yet even this has been expanding regularly. Most of what we do these days is online, so you really can't go wrong for the price. The battery lasts at least 8 hours in between charges. Good Stuff!

B01CVKKZ60,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,14 November 2016,the United States,False,"**Important Edit**
Why they put completely different computers on an already established product's page? Probably to make it look more established than the currently listed computer actually is. Please understand that the following review reflects the Lenovo N22 Model 80SF Chromebook and only that computer.
**Review**
It's exactly what I paid for. I just wanted a small, light, and relatively cheap laptop I could use for note taking in class, and that's exactly what I got. I read a review about them not turning on or something, and so of course I was a little worried but went for it anyways(if it goes wrong, there's always refunds). I was also worried when after pulling it out of the box and pressing the power button, it did not in fact turn on. However, I plugged it in and guess what? It turned on. So I guess it just needs a little kickstart the first time, I don't know. The keyboard is a little smaller than I'm used to, so that'll take a bit of time, but the computer itself is great. The design is simple and clean, I personally prefer black because white computers get dirty and look gross(Looking at you, Mac). This is not a touch screen, but it does have a kind of handle on it. If you close it, there will be a distinguishable little section between the joints of the screen, if you pull it, your laptop turns int a briefcase. It's actually kind of hilarious, but if you find that useful, all power to you. If you actually want a laptop that can do a bunch of things, this probably is not the one for you. Chrome OS is specifically built to run google applications. It runs Netflix, and other browser based programs as well, but I don't think external applications are really what Chromebooks are built for. As long as you understand that, these are really great computers in general, and I highly recommend them for light-load computer things(Google docs, Netflix, Amazon, etc.).

B01CVKKZ60,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,18 April 2017,the United States,False,"I bought this just to mess around with ChromeOS and to get something with good battery life for everyday use.
I am happy with this purchase so far.

Pros:
1. ChromeOS. No viruses. I think this is a big seller and I can see how these are very popular in education after looking at the management tools for them.
2. Price. Can't beat a laptop that can do (email, web browsing, social media, Netflix, etc.). Also would be great as a laptop for a child without breaking the bank as well as being able to monitor your child's usage by setting up supervised user accounts.
3. I know this is not a huge thing, but I do like the rotating webcam.
4. I have tried Netflix and Amazon video on it and have not had any stuttering problems.
5. Battery Life. I get about 7-8 hours of battery life, so can't complain about that. I am sure if you just use email and light web browsing you can get much better.
6. This laptop is on the list to (hopefully soon) get Google PlayStore apps. This will make it a lot more useful after having access to all the Apps on Playstore.
7. The keys are nice. They don't feel cheap. I would say they are close to what I have on my Macbook air, but a little bit stiffer. I also like the clickable mouse pad feel.

Cons:
1. The speakers are a bit low. I have to turn up the volume almost all the way to watch Netflix.
2. You cannot create a local password, you have to use your Gmail password. The problem with that is I use 1Password, which is not supported on ChromeOS, and I have a long password for gmail with random numbers and letters. So I have to open 1Password on my phone and key the password in every time. Would be nice to be able to set a local password. You can set a pin, but this is only to come out of sleep mode.
3. It does seem to lag a bit when opening some websites. Not a huge thing, but a minor annoyance.

If you are looking for a cheap laptop to use for surfing this is a great buy.
I have had no problems with power. The only problem I had was it didn't come charged so I had to plug it in first.

Although plastic, the machine has a rugged feel, and it has all connectivity you want from a machine that travels with you. It's upgradeable (I put 8 GB into mine and a 1 TB SSD), and you can operate it with two batteries, a lighter, smaller version and a more powerful, heaver option that stands out at the back but gives you considerable extra work time.

So i unboxed & plugged it in my lounge, next to my laptop where i always use my gadgets, and began the set up process. That is when the issues started, it kept whizzing around saying it was unable to connect to the router (Even though ive never had issues with laptops in the same spot) so I had to take everything (Remember its a PC not a laptop) keyboard, mouse, screen, speaker & PC to my front door, sit on the ground, plug a cable in, and hey presto the finish the set up.

All done, back in the lounge and noticed even though it was set up that it was struggling with YouTube streaming. So I turned off PC router etc came back next day - same isssue. In the end I was left with no option other than relocating everything to a small desk near the front door where it now sits and works perfectly.

It is working superfast streaming now, no other issues apart from what I wrote. It really is an amazing little piece of kit and i highly rec (Especially now they dropped the price) Perhaps what happened was just me my bad luck I don't know. But if your router is near to where you plan on using then buy it 100%

B0D6X8T4QS,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,2 July 2024,the United States,False,"I've waited a little over a week to review this laptop as my experience with other laptops I've purchased has been so poor! However, so far my experience this time has been dramatically different and better. My previous (pos) HP frustrated and angered me to no end for a couple of years with how slow and unresponsive it was in all aspects. This time I purchased a laptop with much more RAM, which obviously was a much smarter move on my part than in the past, and it seems to be paying off dramatically. The internet response time, the responsiveness of my apps simply in opening and closing and completing transactions quickly has actually been very impressive. Installing programs has been speedy and easy. Whereas doing something as simple as restarting my previous HP was so painfully slow, this one with the amount of RAM included has been pretty much a breeze. As I've SAID, the amount of RAM in my previous laptop obviously was a big problem, so I can't completely blame the PC itself but this machine has been an extremely pleasant surprise and it's performance so far exceeds what I expected to see.
Bluetooth/internet/Wi-Fi connections were completed pretty painlessly. Overall set up of Windows was also fairly easy and - as I've said before - speedy. As described, it is very light, the screen is certainly crisp enough for everyday purposes, there's more than ample storage space for programs and files. And, the 32Gb model clearly provides very responsive performance! I can't judge whether it's a good machine for more power user type of activities like gaming and very high graphic programs, but for the everyday user - internet, videos, music, Office docs, etc this seems like a very good machine at a very good price. Assuming my early experience stays consistent, I can highly recommended this machine!

Occasionally it will just stop sending and receiving data to/from the internet, but will still claim that it's connected; I only know WiFi is not working because browser pages will just stop loading or updating, and then I have to close the cover, wait a few seconds, and then log back in to fix it. This happens on my home network, and did not happen with previous Chromebooks, nor does it happen with any other devices in my home.

I'm not sure why some Chromebooks can't run Android apps, but this one can't, which is also frustrating, as it would be nice to use a larger screen and keyboard for certain apps as opposed to using my phone.

B0BTQWR77M,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,30 April 2024,the United States,False,"It's still very early days so I can't comment on durability yet. But I will provide some opinions and commentary.

This Acer Swift Go 14 replaced a new Asus Zenbook 14 with OLED screen and Core Ultra 155h. The Asus arrived with a defective touchpad so it went back to BestBuy.

So enough history. I had been lusting after this Acer unit for quite a number of months so, when the Asus went south and Amazon dropped the price on the Acer, I ordered it. It arrived in two days (as promised). Came with a zippered case (which I haven't even opened yet).

Forgot that it had a touchscreen; I'll never use it as the screen doesn't fold back into tablet mode so it's essentially worthless to me; they could have left it out and sold it for less. I guess everybody wants an iPad wannabe, eh?

The screen itself, however, is sharp and clear and very bright. I tend to keep it at 50% brightness as I computer indoors. The 1920x1200 resolution is perfect. I keep it at 125% magnification and can read the small lettering just fine with my glasses.

The keyboard has plenty of key travel (unlike MacBooks) and the touchpad, which I don't think is a Synaptics, operates well. It's not oversized (as Macs tend to be) but feels right to me. Tapping, two-finger scrolling, three- and four-finger swipes are supported (as is a traditional ""click"" if you press).

Performance: Very speedy; feels as fast if not faster than the Asus Zenbook I returned. If I could install Windows 10, I might do that only because Win11 gets in my way with its incessant nagging and suggesting and whining. Maybe when I figure out how to turn off all the annoyances, I'll be happier with Win11.

General Design: One of the things I've liked about Acer non-gaming laptops/notebooks is their ""vanilla"" design ethos. Keep it simple and clean. The case of this Swift is a lovely somewhat squared-off ""chiseled"" look in the same sense as an Ioniq 5. I think the manufacturing execution is not quite Apple quality--the case port edges are a little sharper than Apple would permit--but everything plugs in the way it should. The keyboard is recessed below the palm rest a bit so your greasy fingers won't end up leaving marks on the screen when you close the lid. Speaking of the keyboard, it's nice and large with well-spaced keys and adequate backlighting.

Battery life: Ran it for about 6+ hours with lots of web use. I think I had about 50% left. No complaints.

As I think about it, the Acer reminds me most of my 13"" 2012 MacBook Pro although it's a larger screen, higher resolution, incredibly faster, and about 1.25 lbs lighter. :D That Mac was, IMHO, the pinnacle of Mac laptop design. I think Acer has done a great job with this unit.

I'll report back in a few months regarding any QC issues that, hopefully, won't pop up.

B0BTQWR77M,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,31 October 2022,the United States,False,"As a relatively inexpensive and light laptop, the Acer Swift 3 is pretty solid. It's not a heavy duty laptop and it isn't going to be a great option for gaming or video editing or anything that requires a lot of processing power, but as a general purpose laptop for surfing the web or watching YouTube videos it's going to be perfectly functional.

It weighs in around 2.6-2.8lbs (my scale isn't very precise and the reading fluctuated between the two after several tries), which makes it quite easy to carry around without feeling weighed down. The construction feels about what I would expect for a computer in this price range, which is to say it's not top quality but it's not flimsy either. The keyboard is not overly clicky, although it is a bit louder than i would like. I am generally not a fan of laptop keyboards as I prefer a bit more responsiveness but all things considered it's not bad. The backlighting on the keyboard works well.

The Cinebench score was a rather pedestrian 5000. But regardless of benchmarks, I have found it works perfectly well for my everyday needs. I can have a full-screen video running on one screen while surfing the web on another with no lag or hiccups. I keep several programs open all the time (including Chrome which is a serious memory hog) and the laptop doesn't have any performance issues. Considering the price point I am very satisfied with its performance.

The one negative about the setup is that the RAM cannot be upgraded (I got 8gb and wanted 16gb but wasn't going to pay the ridiculous cost difference to buy it pre-installed). I also would have liked 1 more usb port, but 2 is pretty standard so it's not something I would hold against it. Overall I am very satisfied with this laptop. If you don't carry your laptop around very much you might consider looking around for other options because there are probably other more performant options around this price range at the cost of more weight. But if you want a portable, inexpensive laptop that performs well on common everyday tasks then this is a great choice.

B0BLGHYDRB,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,16 April 2023,the United States,False,"I am delighted to give the ASUS Chromebook Touchscreen Flip 16"" 2in1 Laptop a fantastic 4.5-star review. This laptop is an exceptional device that is ideal for students, professionals, and anyone who wants to stay connected and productive on the go.

The 12th Gen Intel Core i3-1215U 6Core processor with 8GB of RAM provides plenty of power to handle multitasking and demanding applications with ease. I love how fast and responsive the laptop is, and the 160GB of storage space is more than enough to store all my files, documents, and media.

The 16"" touchscreen display is simply amazing, offering stunning visuals with excellent color accuracy and brightness. The 2in1 design allows me to use it as a laptop or tablet, which is perfect for on-the-go use.

The build quality of the laptop is excellent, and it feels sturdy and durable in my hands. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the touchpad is smooth and responsive. I also appreciate the long battery life, which allows me to use it for hours without needing to charge it.

******** ISSUE I had with it was that when it first updated the screen went black for about 3 hours witch was a scary situation especially being that I had to work that Monday. Thankfully I toyed with it for a while into I got it to reset.

Overall, I highly recommend the ASUS Chromebook Touchscreen Flip 16"" 2in1 Laptop to anyone looking for a versatile, powerful, and reliable laptop that can keep up with their demanding needs. It is a fantastic device that will not disappoint!

B0BL35XNF5,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,14 September 2023,the United States,False,"I bought this laptop for writing and taking online classes primarily, and it's just perfect. Keyboard is nice to use. Screen is bright and crisp. Laptop is lightweight.

This is NOT a laptop for gaming, video editing, demanding graphics work, and you're probably going to get frustrated if you are a busy, multi-tasker with multiple software and dozens of browser tabs open at the same time.

That being said, for basic computing needs (word processing, watching Netflix, web browsing, blogging, writing a novel, taking classes, etc...), this laptop is near perfect and budget-friendly.

Couple Notes:

- The processor is 1.1 ghz, not 2.8 as listed in description, but really, you wouldn't be doing anything on this that should ever require that much processor speed.

- Memory is upgradeable, which is nice, but I've found that 4gb is fine for what I'm using it for right now.

- Laptop looks stylish, but lacks that ""high-end"" feel - but it's a $200 laptop. Still, I like it and keyboard feels good for typing at length.

- Screen is sharp. Colors are decent. Not the best screen out there, of course, but certainly not bad at all. Not a touch screen...slight bummer but not a big deal to me.

- Sound coming from speakers is nice and loud. No, not premium sound, but sufficient to watch movies/video classes and hear it just fine. I'm happy with it, but no audiophile. Use headphones or a Bluetooth speaker if you want better sound.

- Performance has been fast and I've been satisfied.

- Easy to switch from Windows S to full Windows Home, which is my preference and why I opted for this over a Chromebook.

- 81gb of available storage space after OS and apps take up a bit of the 128 gb drive. To me, that's totally fine since I'm not saving anything on this - it all goes in the cloud.

- I don't think the battery will actually last 9 hours with normal settings, but I get a solid 5 or so hours out of it between charges.

RE: Slowness/Lagginess:

A couple negative reviews mentioned this and when it happened to me, I thought that maybe there WAS something off about this computer.

Turns out when I logged into my Microsoft account, it started syncing my existing desktop computer with this laptop, and with only 4gb of memory and slower processor, it just bogged it right down for about 20 minutes or so as it synced apps, desktop icons, etc.... Once everything synced up, it was fine and has been ever since.

So if you experience slow, laggy performance when you first get this, and you've logged into your Microsoft account, set it down and let it sync for 20 minutes or so, or better yet, adjust the sync settings to be more selective.

All in all, it's a great, inexpensive laptop that is super lightweight, super portable, looks nice, performs great, and is perfect for basic computing, an older child/teen, college courses, etc...

the battery life SUCKS. it lasts about 45 mins. i always have to keep the laptop plugged in. the laptop still takes forever to turn on when you hold the power button too. but besides all of that, roblox still runs great. which was my main use for the laptop. so if you want a affordable laptop just to use roblox, i recommend. just keep in mind you’d have to keep the laptop plugged in all the time, which can be annoying.

i bought this laptop mainly for browsing, netflix, youtube, and roblox. this laptop runs roblox GREAT. no lag, no freezing, & the app loads up quickly. i’m so happy.

— the PROS of this laptop:
it works perfectly fine. i bought it used to save some money, and this laptop works like its brand new. the setup process was pretty easy, and its not slow loading up websites n apps. i was afraid that this laptop being in S mode would give me a problem, but i turned it off with a click of one button and that was it. S mode was turned off instantly and now i can download or search whatever website i want.

— the CONS of this laptop:
the sound quality isn’t the best.. and the screen quality isn’t the best either. is it doable? yes. have i seen better? also yes. also, this laptop takes a while to turn on, i have to hold the power button for 20 secs for it to turn on.

-

but anyways, i would recommend to anyone looking for a laptop on a budget!

how did i turn S mode off? i wanted a new browser to use, so i chose google chrome. i went to download it, and it said something like “google chrome cannot be downloaded because this PC is in S mode” and it literally told me how to turn it off, it took less than 5 secs to turn it off. some other review said that they went through a lot to turn S mode off, so that’s why i was hesitant to buy this laptop, but everything ended up working out perfectly. i’m satisfied with this purchase tbh. i think it’s worth the money 100%.

Es la lap más completa y rápida que he tenido.

Dudas que me surgieron antes de comprar:

Teclado retroiluminado: Si (2 niveles de intensidad)
Huella táctil en botón de encendido: Si
Pantalla: 14"" para interiores tiene buen desempeño, para exterior si queda a deber, pero funciona bien.
Procesador: Ryzen 5 5500U
RAM: 8 GB (4 soldadas a la placa y un slot con 4 más) Soporta hasta 20 GB
Teclado: en inglés, aunque se configura a español
Color: Azul
El cuerpo de la lap es plástico, aunque da la apariencia de ser aluminio, pero es de buena calidad.
El modelo exacto es: IdeaPad 3 14ALC6
SSD: 254 GB
2 puertos USB
1 HDMI
1 Ranura para tarjetas de memoria SD
1 Puerto Tipo C
1 conector 3.5 para audífonos

Me costó 12 000 (a 12 MSI, pero se puede hasta 18 con algunas tarjetas) pagando el envío rápido y me regresaron 120 de los gastos de importación, prácticamente lo que me costó el envío rápido. He visto reseñas de personas que les llega solo la caja y adentro leche, paquetes de hojas, piedras, supongo que en la paquetería se las roban, lo aconsejable es hacer un video del unboxing para tener evidencia en caso de que les pase algo así, en este sentido recomiendo pagar el envío rápido, a mi me llegó por UPS, creo que es más seguro.

En conclusión, es una lap muy buena, muy rápida y por el precio difícilmente van a encontrar una similar por debajo de los 15 mil. Lo que extraño en mi caso es la pantalla de 15"" estaba acostumbrado a mi lap anterior con pantalla más grande y un puerto USB más estaría perfecto.

B08YKDYWK5,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,19 November 2022,the United States,False,"I was a little skeptical about this laptop considering the price, but I am amazed!

Three things right out the gate: 1) It's listed as Abyss Blue but it's actually a silver/metallic color which I'm not angry about because it looks good. 2) It's listed as 14"" but it's actually 15.6"" which again I'm not angry about lol 3) It's stated as Windows 10 Home for the operating system but it comes with Windows 11 which this is my first time using the OS and I haven't run into any issues with it so once again I'm not angry!

Now onto the rest: I read a review in which their laptop didn't have the correct graphics card in it. I can confirm mine does indeed have the 6 core, 12 thread AMD Ryzen 5 5500U. In fact, everything else is as stated in the description and it's wonderful! It is quick to start up and all programs so far run quickly. I haven't tried playing a newer game on it yet so that will be the biggest test for this laptop that I would be able to put it through. Otherwise, it operates the web and my usual desktop applications perfectly fine.

The few negatives I have: 1) The sound is not the best as the speakers are inside the elbow where the screen meets the body. 2) Even though the keyboard has a full ten key pad, the enter key is small and I find my finger hitting the 4 key rather than the enter some times (just have to learn this keyboard better) 3) The battery life seems decent. I'm taxing this system more than I am my work laptop, but it still seems to drain slightly faster than I expect.

Overall I'm very happy I got this laptop so far as it has exceeded my expectations at pretty much every turn.

B08NV6LT1Q,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 August 2021,the United States,False,"I'd recently donated my Zenbook travel laptop to a friend and was looking for a replacement. Did a bit of research and stumbled upon the Yoga 6 and decided to take the plunge. The machine arrived as described and, out of the box, provided a nice, snappy experience.

I went ahead and replaced the internal SSD with a 1 TB SSD and added a matte screen protector. So now I've got a machine where I can replicate all my files on Google Drive and I can use outside in fairly bright light (the regular glossy screen was not conducive to working outside).

I use the machine to do basic tasks - web, email, videos - but it also handles my video editing software and many of my ""casual"" games with aplomb. The screen is nice and bright, the SSD speedy and the AMD Ryzen 7 keeps up with pretty much everything I throw at it. I've never been a big touch screen user, so I don't really use this machine that way, but the screen appears to be responsive. The touchpad works fine, although I usually turn it off and use a mouse - in this case a bluetooth mouse which works great. The keyboard is reasonably comfortable to type on and is backlit (2 brightness settings!).

As for the ports on the machine, it has a couple of USB-C ports including the charging port. Each of the USB-C ports are DisplayPorts and I purchased a small USB-C hub with HDMI that I use when I want to attach to an external display. It also has a regular USB-A port and a headphone/mic combo port.

While the Levovo ads will say that it has an 18 hour battery, you'd have to turn back the brightness on the screen and use maximum power savings in order to achieve anything near that. In my real life usage, I'm getting about 6-7 hours because I like a bright screen and don't want to throttle anything back!

So, overall, I've been very happy with the machine and its small size makes it a perfect travel companion. While it won't replace my gaming laptop for modern games (didn't expect it to), its fitness for purpose - a small, light general use laptop for travel - is spot on and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.

B08F93HGNB,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,4 January 2025,the United States,False,"It works perfectly. The only thing for which I would take a star is the fact that it takes a whole day to update the laptop, you have to update windows too and the bios had to be updated as well. Other than that, it's great!

Pros:

- Snappy for it's price
- Screen is incredibly bright, way beyond what I had expected
- No bloatware except for maybe Alexa but that can be uninstalled quickly
- I can run MGTA maxed out at 1080P and it runs pretty well (Had to test the GPU hah)
- Surprisingly well built except for the front edges which feel a little sharp but it's passable for the price
- Is not a fingerprint magnet!!

Meh:

- After updates, installing office and college apps, you end up with 150GBs~
- If you want to update Windows and the bios, you have to lose the windows S mode (doesn't really impact the performance to be honest)

Cons:

- Touchpad has a certain click sound when I tap it (not click it) that feels almost like if it's loose but when you check real close is NOT. Feels weird at first but if you mess around enough with the touchpad it feels solid (it has a mechanical click function which also feels pretty solid)

- Computer seems to get a little bit hot when running CPU intensive tasks (relative to its CPU), such as playing MGTA while listening to a youtube music video

- Keyboard feels a little bit chunky at first but the tactile feeling when using it compensates the fact that it's a little bit bigger than what I would've preferred

- I knew the speakers weren't going to be great and I was spot on. Although they get loud, the sound is just not right. I thought of this in advance and added a pair of apple's earpods with the 3.5MM plug solely for this

Can't think of anything else really important, it covers everything I needed. I only wish it had a backlit keyboard but at this price you really can't complain for what you get.

I haven't had any issues with it at all, despite worldwide travel and extreme heat/cold field conditions. I did leave the the original charger i a hotel room - all you need is a USB C to charge this laptop! I had no idea until I went to BestBuy to search for a new Lenovo computer charger!

My first Lenovo ThinkPad, which I paid $630 for, lasted 7+ years and traveled the world a few times with me in extreme heat, cold, damp, et al conditions. I wrote 4 books and over 30 articles, taught online grad school and completed a 4 year PhD program on that workhorse - probably averaged 8-10 hours on it daily. Still works fine, I just wanted updated features (which this one has) - backlit keyboard, better screen resolution, brighter screen, improved touchscreen, fingerprint reader, pen, fast charging/longer lasting battery, et al. The yoga is nice since you can use it flat, tented and turned around so the screen shows to clients, tented and facing you for movie watching, or as a tablet.

As expected, this ThinkPad worked perfectly right out of the box, very easy set up! Logged into my Microsoft account and immediately loaded Word, PowerPoint, et al products. Edge is the primary browser, but I downloaded Safari and Firefox, logged in and had all of my bookmarks and passwords. Logged into Norton, had protection in seconds and access to my password vault. Using Lenovo Vantage app, you can wirelessly transfers folders from the desktop of your old Lenovo to the new computer. I was completely set up in about 30 minutes. The speed of opening files, downloading and Internet browsing is probably twice that of my prior ThinkPad, so I feel more efficient bouncing back and forth between my projects, files and open tabs.

For the price, this is a fantastic computer! I can't think of anything it lacks. ThinkPads are built to military specs - strong case, water resistant, etc. Hoping to get 7 years out of this one, as well!

B088PF3C45,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,9 August 2021,the United States,False,"QUICK, IMPORTANT NOTE: the 1-start rating is not much of a ding against the Lenovo Thinkpad L13 Yoga as a computer, and this is definitely no ding on Amazon itself. (In fact, how Amazon handled the immediate negative experiences I had with suppliers is rather reassuring as to how they handle their side of commitments.)

But this is an ABSOLUTE DING against two suppliers to Amazon who sold me Thinkpad L13s in NEW condition: one supplier gave me an L13 that was out of the manufacturer's 1-year warranty eight months early -- and the other one sold me a computer that was out of the 1-year warranty two days before I even bought it!

These are not a he-said, she-said situations. Lenovo, as it turned out, has something like an ""internal odometer"" in what they call their Vantage utility. (Among a lot of other things, the utility shows when a warranty begins and when it ends; screen shots showing the premature expirations of the warranty included with this review.)

I bought the first Thinkpad L13 Yoga in December of 2020. When I began to have a problem in June of this year with one of the ports, I thought no big deal, it is still under warranty. But it wasn't: the 1 -year warranty on the L13 began in April 2020 (8 months before I bought it) and the warranty expired in May 2021. I then called Amazon, and an Amazon rep appraised the situation; he then asked me if I would like a replacement or a refund. I requested a replacement IF the supplier would actually give me an L13 in NEW condition the next time around. The Amazon rep got back to me later the same day and said the supplier declined to supply a replacement in NEW condition; but the rep was able to negotiate a refund that was 83% of the original December 2020 purchase price. I not only did not quibble with the Amazon rep on the resolution, I think it shows Amazon in good light. Still a bummer in that I lost a software license that was tied to the life of that computer.

I really liked the Thinkpad L13 Yoga. My experience with Lenovo computers is overall very good: I still have an 11-inch Yoga that is working just fine 9 years later but whose operating system is no longer supported (Microsoft Windows-RT), and I also have one of their Think Centre mini PCs which has been flawless. And as the Lenovo Thinkpad line has very good industry ratings for reliability -- and as my overall experiences with Amazon have been very positive -- I had no real qualms about ordering another L13 in NEW condition from another Amazon supplier that had higher customer satisfaction ratings.

But second time around was even worse: the 1-year warranty on that L13 had expired two days before I ordered it! There was a tell on the box I received: the original red, rectangular Lenovo seal tape was torn off, leaving a strip mark on the carton. A somewhat clumsily placed, round ""Lenovo"" clear seal with black lettering partially covered the strip mark. And sure enough, when I looked at the Vantage utility on the Lenovo, it confirmed that I had again been snookered again and sold another computer on Amazon that was not in NEW condition. So that L13 went back too.

In both cases, a manufacturer's internal utility was the only way I discovered that suppliers to Amazon were selling me used-and-returned/refurbished computers that they had advertised as NEW. My experiences represent only two data points; but what do you think the odds would have been if I had tried buying an L13 on Amazon a third time? The even bigger question is: how would you as a customer know whether you were really getting a computer in NEW condition from Amazon if the manufacture of the computer you are thinking of buying does not have this kind of ""internal odometer"" to let you know what is really up?

It is perfect for travel being very compact and light (even the charger is small and compact), but nonetheless the keyboard is a reasonable size and comfortable for typing. For the kind of basic use I make of it (drafting Word documents, and PowerPoint slides, writing emails and browsing the internet) it seems fast and snappy and boots up much more quickly than my desktop. The keyboard is pleasant to use, although it is not backlit as advertised. The track pad works well, but I have not been able to figure out how to use it as a calculator pad. I use a small generic wired mouse with the laptop that does not take up much space and it works well. Battery life is impressive.

The screen is a bit dull and lacks sharpness, and colours don't leap out at you either, so it is probably not something you would want to use primarily as a device to watch movies and videos. The case and screen hinge seems robust and it seems well put together, but I'm not sure how well it would stand up to really rough handling.

B081V6W99V,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,8 June 2021,the United States,False,"I bought this machine because I was looking for a small, inexpensive machine with good battery life to use for writing and media consumption when travelling, without having to worry much about it being damaged, broken or stolen.

This laptop comes with a 64GB eMMC disk which is small and not very fast. I bought an M.2 SSD to add to this laptop as the primary disk (I bought a Western Digital SN550 SSD). To add the M.2 SSD, you have to remove the ten screws at the bottom of the laptop (there are two different lengths of screw, so mark the holes with the longer screws when removing). Removing the bottom cover is a bit tricky because it is very tight - start at a corner and insert plastic credit card or similar into the gap, Then pull the credit card around the seam to pop off the clips (the trick is to not push the credit card too far into the seam, or it will get caught. Insert it only a tiny bit into the seam and it will glide easily). Once you have removed the bottom cover the place to insert the SSD is labelled on the motherboard. You just push it in, then add a single screw to secure it. The screw doesn't ship with the SSD usually, but if you need one you can buy a kit for a few dollars - search for ""M.2 mounting screws"" and you can get a kit with screws and screwdriver in the correct size, which can also be used to remove the case screws.

Once you've added the SSD, it won't appear in windows until you've formatted it in disk manager, which you can open by searching for ""disk"" in start menu and hitting ""create and format hard disk partitions"".

Once formatted, you can use it as a regular disk, but for best performance, reinstall windows on the SSD. To do that, create Windows 10 installation media - search google for ""Create installation media for Windows"" then follow instructions. You'll need a USB drive that's 8GB or bigger.

Once you've created installation media, install Windows on SSD (hit F2 when booting laptop to get into BIOS to select startup disk). Drivers are available from ASUS site (search ""asus L210 drivers"" then hit ""support""). Windows will automatically find the digital license for your machine and activate.

Running on the SSD, performance for the machine is very good considering the price. Processor is fast enough to watch 4K youtube videos, should you wish to. Keyboard is fine-to-good. Touchpad is OK - good considering price. Speakers are not great, but good enough for watching youtube and as good as I would expect for this price and size. There is no backlit keyboard but that's not something I care about. Screen is fine, good for price. Overall build quality feels very good compared to other units in this price range. Machine feels light.

Battery life is excellent - using windows 10 ""battery saver"" mode (activate by pressing speech bubble in bottom right of task bar then hitting battery save) I routinely get 12 hours or more with normal usage and medium brightness, which is really excellent for the price in my opinion.

If you want a small, cheap machine with very good battery life and decent performance, and you are willing to add the M.2 SSD, this is a great choice.

This laptop is super light for how much power it packs. The graphics are great, the system is fast, and it can easily a handful of VMs at once. However, with gaming, this laptop gets HOT very quickly (running WoW on 7/10). The cooling fans are efficient, but very loud, I have to turn up the volume on my TV or stereo quite a bit when the fans are running. Both of these things are to be expected from such a small machine running so much power. I look forward to traveling with it and it's great for work at home, but I will continue gaming on my Asus ROG at home.",3
B07V5TGY48,G.,2.0,Update: had to return it.,20 March 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"UPDATE: RETURNED
After a couple of weeks it begun having sudden slowdowns that lasted a second or two. This would happen under any load and with no apparent trigger. Eventually become a p.i.t.a because it would happen a lot. Checked ram, ssd, gpu and cpu health with correct results, resetted to factory defaults twice.. no success. Finally returning the item tomorrow for a refund. Getting a new one, hope it was just my unit that was faulty. Otherwise, great machine.

Just three days into ownership but I must say I am very pleased. I bought this laptop to work with 3d modelling and rendering, which I haven't tested yet... but, I did throw some games on high/ultra at her and she's been nothing but brilliant, with good fps counts.
Constructions seems sturdy, as the body is metal. It's hefty but not heavy enough not to be portable, super thin considering the power it packs. Screen/bezel ratio is great and the whole thing looks good (not too gamerish, except for the Predator logo on the lid, but not too bad). Keyboard has 3 zone rgb, and PredatorSense UI makes it easy to adjust performance, lighting and such at the touch of a button, litteraly, as you you will hit that button countless times because it is very poorly placed beside the backspace key :( The whole keyboard is slightly cramped, but that's what you'll get in anything under 17'', and touchpad is responsive and has good texture.
Sound quality is terrible, and it does run hot when pushed... but all that power needs to be cooled so it is absolutely in the expected ballpark. Didn't notice thermal throttling and with the turbo button, fans (or jet engines more accurately) just deal with it. Loudly as hell, but then again, expected.

This laptop is no beast, BUT the N6000 CPU is surprisingly powerful compared to similar chips. One thing i should be clear about is that I purchased this so i could have a portable Linux system. Windows 11, in my opinion, didn't run very well. after Installing 'Linux Mint: Cinnamon Edition' it runs like a dream. In fact, I'm on it right now, writing this review.

Another very important thing to talk about is the hard drive. IT CAN BE UPGRADED! It uses an NVME 2242. This is an oddball size and can be harder to find. I suggest a 2230 model and purchase an ""Extender"" to make it fit properly. I put a 2TB Western Digital Black in mine.

Things I don't like... It didn't come with a pen. And even though the USB ports are USB3, I wish there were more. There is only one USB C port and that's for power, but you can get a USB C hub to feed it power and add more ports.

B077GGZTTR,Mark M,5.0,Well made and versatile laptop,5 March 2019,the United Kingdom,False,"I've had this laptop for over a month now and I'm really impressed with it. It feels robust and well made, but is light and thin. The screen is excellent, it's also a touch screen which is very useful, particularly when running Android apps.

For the most part I use it as a laptop, but you can fold the screen back to make a tablet.

The keyboard has a nice feel to it and I've really appreciated the back lit keys more than once.

Admittedly I have the i7 variant, but it does seem fast and have had no concerns so far as to its performance.

The fact that you can install Android apps is brilliant, and although some of the apps I've installed don't take full advantage of the screen size, it is really useful to have such a wide range of apps available.

Whilst I think this devices is an excellent computer for anyone, my prime motivation was as a development machine, for both server side and Android development. In this context it really shines, it is without doubt the best laptop I owned, including a number of MacBook pros.

The fact that I can use Android Studio or Visual Studio Code to develop Android apps and then directly run them on the device, without needing to use an emulator is a joy.
I can attach two external screens, so including its own screen, have three available, individually setting the scaling on each screen.
Multiple Linux containers can be installed, I've not fully exploited this capability, with just a couple installed currently, but I can see the potential where I can manage different containers for different customers, each with different requirements.

To be honest I'm surprised that there aren't more people using this as a development machine.

B077GGZTTR,Customer,5.0,Worth it.,6 December 2018,the United Kingdom,False,"There is absolutely nothing about this laptop/tablet hardware that I don't like. I've used a Macbook as my daily driver for the previous 8 years. On this go around I really felt that the Mac hardware was simply not worth the premium, especially given how much extra you have to pay to get something with sufficient specs overhead to make it last for longer than 2-3 years.

At the time of writing Dec 2018, I'd suggest the following thought process when deciding whether or not to buy one of these, ""Do I do +95% of my work/actual usage of this device online through a browser?"" If yes, then just buy it. If not then go for something else.

Pro's:
- This device is incredibly well thought out,
- the keyboard is excellent and the silicone wrist rests are incredibly comfy, and for people who do a lot of typing that's incredibly important.
- The screen is excellent
- unbelieveably fast and smooth to use.
- battery life is truly 7-8 hours of actual real world useage
- you can install coding Linux apps like Atom on it if you switch the OS channel
- it's LIGHTWEIGHT and rigid, you can easily backpack it and not worry about bringing it on a long bike ride to an office due to its weight.

Cons:
- it's a very very slick chrome browser.
- Android apps on it are OK, but actually a downgrade from the browser experience, only have them to allow productivity in true offline mode, eg on a plane.
- Cannot run Adobe applications eg Photoshop, Premiere, Illustrator natively, I just remote desktop my PC with all the processing horsepower instead.

B01BN9XL0C,Amazon Customer,5.0,Great laptop,1 October 2016,the United Kingdom,False,"I've had the Surface Book for over a month now, and I have to say I'm very happy with it.

+ Amazing screen, with ultra high resolution, excellent colour reproduction, and fantastic viewing angles. Even when I'm using the screen as a tablet it's still pin sharp. Combined with the 3:2 aspect ratio, the 13.5 inch screen feels more like a 14 or 15 inch in actual use- lots of real estate to work with.

+ Large, smooth, accurate glass trackpad. The only trackpad I've used on a Windows machine that rivals Apple's trackpads. The keyboard is by far the best I've used- and much better than those shallow butterfly ones they've put on the new MacBook pro's.

+ Ability to detach screen and reattach the other way is awesome. Stylus is decent and good for taking notes and sketching with, although I'll be honest; my iPad Pro with its Apple Pencil has spoilt me for digital drawing and note taking. This doesn't quite compare with that but it's still good.

+ Windows 10 is awesome! A very sleek and clean operating system, and Microsoft Edge is brilliant- I don't use any other web browser now. Gestures and scrolling and swiping to switch between desktops and screens is so fast and fluid (and reliable). Windows Ink and the drawing feature in Edge is so much fun; the ability to scrawl over webpages and save them is nice to have. It also comes preloaded with very little bloatware.

+ Windows Hello facial recognition to log in has made my life so much better. Cold boot takes about 10 seconds.

+ Battery life is also good. On average I usually do get the promised 12 hours- sometimes I get up to 15 and sometimes only 8 or 9. I am expecting this to drop over time as all batteries do, but very impressive so far. The charger is relatively small and neat, and attaches using a magnetic pin.

+ It looks and feels beautiful. The body is made of a matte, slightly textured magnesium alloy. It doesn't feel as silky smooth as some other aluminium laptops, but I kind of like the texture. The minimalist industrial design is something I keep admiring.

+ It's relatively light and portable. The book- like form factor means that it's comfortable on the hands when carrying it around- the sharp edges, which are so neat to look at, don't dig into your hands.

I can't really think of any minor drawbacks but so far:

- Heats up a little when running Firefox or Google Chrome. Like I said I'm happy with Edge so I stopped using them, but this is puzzling and shouldn't be happening.

- Heats up quite a bit when running certain design software. Again, this is a reasonable powerful machine and this shouldn't be happening- it wasn't like I was running 3D modelling software or anything too intense.

- In the first week or so the update cycles were a bit of a nuisance. But very worth it, because everything became speedier after every batch of updates.

Overall though I have to say I'm pleased with the machine and it's a pleasure to work with. Microsoft has pulled no compromises with this one. The heat issue is mitigated by the fact that since the computer's main organs and cooling vents are actually in the screen and not the keyboard base as with most laptops, the base never gets too warm for the lap.

B01BN9XL0C,Tavis,2.0,Price too high,28 October 2017,the United Kingdom,False,not a very good laptop for the price sometimes stays on even after shutting down and will sometimes just not turn on!,0
B01BN9XL0C,J. Bond,1.0,Far too many faults to pick for the price!,27 August 2016,the United Kingdom,False,"In my opinion, this machine is far exceeded by it's price and ergonomic problems, than by the aesthetics it affords at it's current price point. It is unfortunate to be a real peacock, looking really rather nice, but dogged by bad performance, bad design decisions, awful performance and lackluster peripherals making this a dismal machine to work with.

The video I leave with this review is a final overview in a series of videos, which I recommend you view if this is your laptop operating system environment of choice, or you are looking seriously for a new daily driver machine for something other than the mundane internet or light office use.

Taking things piece by piece, the brushed aluminium case is very pretty, affording a clean, and light aesthetic. The back-lit keys are very pretty, and they are comfortable to use, however, resting your palms onto the unit and working, if the unit gets even remotely taxed it gets warm, and upon getting warm it starts an internal fan. This fan causes the whole chassis to reverberate, it is so annoying to feel this through your fingers and palms as you work!

This vibration issue leads to a noticeable background hum to the unit whilst it is in heavy use, programming/compiling, rendering video, rendering 3D, streaming, any such activity tax this machine most strenuously, it is a Core i5 processor, so not the lowest of the low, but it feels extremely under-powered. Once hot to the touch, forget about undocking and comfortably holding this unit in tablet mode, the materials used and the position of the heat source (CPU one guesses) within mean that a right handed user is going to try and hold the unit exactly where the heat source is most active, literally burning hot!

So, a pretty design but too hot to handle and too under-powered to actually do any serious work... This is an extremely expensive unit, so you would (or at least I would) assume you are buying it for some serious work, such as rendering customer content on-site with them, or programming whilst on the commute... Or even (as in the TV adverts for this range) going out and about vlogging... Nope, if you buy this you're pretty much limited to low-power activities, light office typing, note taking and internet browsing were the activities I found it best suited for.

Which defeats the point, it's a self-guarantee leading to a fail, you can't work with it, but it costs a lot, you can't have something cost a lot and not work for you... And this is where I personally point my ire directly at Microsoft for the units performance problems, fine, alright, I had the base model, but you can get visibly pleasing designs which also perform.

What else can I pick fault with?... Well, the design itself, is not even very good, buttons (for power & volume) are in a terrible position, they can be cause easily when packing the unit away and turn the unit on whilst it is packed away for travel, resulting in your arriving at location sans power.

The USB ports are in too close proximity to one another, making them pretty useless unless you're carrying extension cables... A self-defeating solution to the problem caused by the design, because, why buy a light, expensive, unit like this just to end up having to cart around a host of additional cables?

Then the cables which come with the unit, known as the charger, it gets incredibly hot whilst in use, and then it also has a USB outlet built directly into it, meaning you are meant, or someone somewhere meant, for you to be able to charge the unit and another device at the same time, only when you plug another device in the charger is not able to handle the load, it switches alternately between powering up the laptop to powering up the external device, ruining batteries in my experience! I do have a direct video demo of this, Microsoft utterly failed to explain the problem, and we're again going to mention the price, for the price this is horrible! Useless!

Charging the unit itself is also a bit of a pain, with low battery you can't undock the tablet, but it does not make this clear, it just fails to respond to the release button press.. with that smug ""I know better than you""... feel of many Microsoft products.

Once released you do have a half decent tablet, but it is only half decent, it's horrible to hold, being too large, too heavy, the edges are (not sharp) but uncomfortable to hold, whilst holding it you are constantly pressing on the camera or edges, you have only one side which is magnetic for the pen to hold onto, so it's pretty poor for left handed users. And then the 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the ""bottom"" of the tablet (assuming the left edge - when docked - is the top as it's the only place the pen magnetizes to) meaning the jack can press into you and be snapping the end of your headphones, or worse still, damaging the tablet portion of the unit!

Turning the tablet around and redocking it, gives you the ""book"" feel of the unit, you can close it back down and start to use it, but only really in landscape mode, in portrait you have the slope to deal with, and again this is going to be a pain for different handed users.

Windows 10 is not part of my review here, but it lends it's number of problems to the unit too, so the least said the better, but it's not a very nice environment to work in, with it you feel as though it's constantly thinking it knows how to do things better, and at first it was quite hard just to get jobs done.

Networking was a problem with the unit, again it's a low power low storage machine, so serious computing had to be done remotely, this means relying heavily on the wireless, which was okay, but not as quick as one would like, but then switching to wired means using a USB to Ethernet wire, and again having to carry it with you as an added wire, again defeating the design.

These additional wires I've added, plus a wallet to hold/carry the unit in, would have been of far more use to me than the fancy box it was delivered in. It's nice to feel you've got something meaty to unbox, but you just unbox the unit, you don't get anything else but the dodgy charger with it. Microsoft then (at the time of writing) have the cheek to charge £35 for a USB to Ethernet cable for the unit... You can get them for a fraction of that cost, so yet another nail into the cost to performance coffin we're hammering home here.

The last failure of the whole design is that the case hinge itself, presses back and rubs on the surface you place the unit on, instantly marking it, add to this that the rubber feet are not really there to give stability and you have a fragile bottom surface being pushed and rubbed as you use the machine; again I mention this in my whole series of videos. But this whole experience with the moving of the unit, again it's cost and then the poor feel to the feet, mean you scratch and mark an expensive machine, and you feel really bad doing it, you want it to look and appear perfect for months or years, not a few minutes!!!!!

Finally, and very succinctly, this machine is not worth the price, it's not durable, it does not perform well, it is not very versatile, it is lumbered with poor peripherals and connectivity options to enable it to access remote resources and warrant its own purpose, and for the price point there are far too many faults to even warrant contemplating buying this unit.

Obviously it does what you would expect any Windows 10 computer to do and it does it well. It's on the practicalities side that it falls short.

The power connector is a joke and falls out at the slightest movement, as does the stylus with its ""magnetic"" stowage. In use you will be constantly hunting for both.

The keyboard is difficult to remove and could cause [problems if, like me, you have dexterity difficulties. Not only does it not open out flat, but it has an extremely limited range of movement overall, and when using the keyboard the screen is invariably at the wrong angle.

The base comes with a host of serious issues:
- Startup time with base attached is appr 5 minutes. Without base attached appr 15 seconds. It just hangs and hangs. (Correction: it turns out this was caused by leaving the BaseQi MicroSD card reader in the slot. When I took it out, startup times were normal.)

B016OW7EBA,Jim Bowen,5.0,"A great computer, but can you justify the cost?",28 January 2017,the United Kingdom,False,"I think in life, you have to decide what you want a computer to do. Being honest, that's the question you MUST ask yourself here. This is probably as powerful an all-in-one tablet-cum-computer that there is in the market. If your thing is computer aided design, or artistic or photographic presentations, and travel a fair bit for work, then you can justify this computer/laptop. If you're mostly office based, I'm sure you can probably justify it too, if your work is design based. Otherwise I would recommend the Surface Pro 4.

This is not meant to be critical of this computer. It is a great computer. The pen is nimble, responsive, and accurate, the i7, 16GB specification is responsive and speedy, and the art functions are impressive. If there was every a computer that suggests that Microsoft could be competing with Apple for the ""artistic market"" now or in the future, then this computer is it.

My grumble would focus on the size of the screen. which is great for a tablet, okay for travel, but a problem for office work. Couple this with the price, and you're probably going to ask yourself, can I justify this for work, or a hobby you're passionate about. If the answer is yes, then buy this. I don't think you'll be disappointed. If it's either hmmm, or no, I'd recommend maybe the Surface Pro 4. Not because This is bad, but because you'll probably struggle justifying the bang you'll get for the buck you spent. I know a lot of firms that use it instead of the Surface Book, and they can't all be wrong.

Overall the laptop is good. Great in some aspects, but misses the mark on occasion.

What we liked:
Fantastic gaming performance, consistently above 60fps at 1080p. The fans can be a bit noisy under duress, but the cooling is top notch. In any case who plays games at a low enough volume to hear noisy fans.

Build quality is great, although the chassis is plastic the hinges are solid. There is absolutely no wobble when it's open.

Good connectivity with 3 USB3 ports, Thunderbolt, and card reader you have no trouble reading or writing to external media.

Lovely keyboard, Good key positions with more spacing than usual between keys which suits me fine but can be an issue for some.

What is disappointing:
The laptop comes with a super fast PCI-E drive, which should really be mentioned in the likes sections above. however, the 1TB HDD is annoyingly slow. This is exacerbated when you consider how quickly you run out of space on a 128GB drive.
Disk IO scores:
HDD - 815 Passmark
PCIE - 7010 Passmark

I'd much rather have a 500GB SSD option than the 1TB HDD.

The trackpad is abysmal, the less said about it the better.

It's expected that a gaming laptop will be heavy, and 3.3kg does not seem like a lot on paper, but you will definitely notice the weight.

The palm rest is a magnet for grease, it simply won't stay clean. Not a big deal but annoying.

It's a shame that they do not have a 1080p touchscreen version of this, as 4K is overkill at this size.

B01N1Z82BY,Daniel C,3.0,"It’s good, but perhaps not worth the money.",1 July 2017,the United Kingdom,False,"I needed to replace a tired six-year-old laptop and balance personal use alongside professional. I pondered long and hard about whether a MacBook Pro merited the additional cost for what I needed but found it hard to justify.
Six months ago, after reading excellent online reviews, I settled on this laptop and purchased the 13.3 inch version with the QHD touchscreen, which gives exceptional detail.
Initially, the XPS 13 seems to deliver the performance of all the things you would expect of a laptop at this price. The layout and design (apart from the odd feature) is very good, but the track pad can be a little annoying as it seems a little over-sensitive. I've learnt the importance of only keeping one hand on it at any one time.
I would praise the robust construction; it feels very solid ... all keys give an experience of working with a quality product. The graphics are good, but I have now also begun to experience the issues with wi-fi expressed elsewhere.
Something which I hadn't noticed before purchase, is that laptops now rarely seem to have a CD or DVD drive - this is an additional purchase which for me was a disappointing and significant omission with a hard-copy library. The shift to downloaded software, music and films may now be the 'norm', but when a drive is quite important to you, this is extremely unhelpful - so be aware that buying this all-singing, all-dancing laptop may not include everything you're expecting.
When I was finally loaded audio editing software onto the system, the line input settings needed changing because the incoming line quality was poor. Attempting to switch to HD input caused it to crash, so it seems to have stability issues - I'll come back to this in a moment.
With no disc drive ... and personal website software to run, it has presented a series of time-consuming issues I could have done without. I must stress this may not apply to many people purchasing this, but I felt I ought to make you aware.
It's hard to tell whether the issues I have with the unit are borne out a Windows 10 system which is at times illogical and irritating, but in terms of the basics, it delivers what you expect.
As a music and broadcast professional who required a machine which would be useful for all the basic stuff, but which could also cope with more industrial workloads of audio and occasional video editing, the past six months have been a struggle.
Much of the software I previously owned needed upgrading and substantially added to the cost. One upgrade left me with unexpected audio problems borne out of an incompatibility with the Dell product - or so says the software manufacturer.
I still haven't resolved the audio quality issues; how can it be that a machine of such high spec is incapable of faithfully reproducing the audio signal imported to the machine? Given that I was intending this to transfer more than thirty years of analogue recordings to a digital archive, this is disappointing to put it mildly.
Earlier, I mentioned above the absence of the DVD drive, but perhaps the most surprising omission is there is no Ethernet connection, so when you need to reset your wireless connection or get a more stable download, bluntly, you are stuck. Yesterday, I found myself going round in a circle because I was unable to update my in-car navigation system because the download demanded the stability of an Ethernet connection – Catch 22.
The inbuilt troubleshooting systems didn’t appear to be able to resolve my issues, so I resorted to the back-up of the online Dell support system to help. However, Dell's backup seemed helpful until completing product registration and then immediately lowered the level of support offered – unless you are a paid business user. It's all a little less than satisfactory really.

IN SUMMARY: I would suggest thinking through your purchase very carefully, but that in hindsight, I wish I had bitten the bullet and bought Apple. They do have outstanding customer service to help you through difficulties.
I bought this machine from Amazon aware of the potential limitations of customer service for these kind of issues, but found my experience at a couple of ‘real’ stores totally unsatisfactory. I had hoped the back of Dell (as a reputable name) would be enough to see me through any problems, but I must confess I am regretting that choice.
Finally, I appreciate not everyone will have similar demands of their laptop, but I would suggest that for the money I paid for this machine there may be better value out there … and would urge you to spend more time evaluating this.
I hope this posting saves others similar misfortune.

I got the i3 128GB with 4GB of ram version and it is exactly what I expected. I am a photographer and got this for location shoots, that have no access to mains power so I can quickly review images and do some basic photoshop work on images ranging from 28MB to 128MB in size. I have listed the pro's and con's with the product bellow, and yes there are a few con's but the pro's out weigh the con's.
Pro's
The price for the i3, with what you get compared to the rest of the competition is unbelievably good the price at the time of this review is 642.80Sterling for the intel i3 processor with 4GB of ram and 128GB SSD. The Huawei mate book 128GB on Amazon UK at the time of this review is 980sterling it dose boast a 3.5Ghz processor but it thermal throttles which means, it will go up to 3.5Ghz but when it reaches 3.5Ghz after a while it will reduces sometimes down to 1.2Ghz because of overheating which is bad for devices like this. Its nearest competitor the Windows surface book pro 128Gb which at the time of this review is 1,0018Sterling on Amazon uk, and you do not get the keyboard which is another 113Sterling so 1,131Sterling ""WOW what a price"".
The keyboard is good. It is a proper keyboard and it is led back light which turns off when not in use. The keyboard fully detaches and if you want you can attache the pen to the tablet in its place and it hold quite solid even under vigorous shaking.
The pen, I must admit I have used a pen before with pc and it turned me off but with this configuration it works very well. I use Photoshop CC with the alpha and it works, for simple tasks like cropping and basic color correction. Anything more complex it just gets annoying but it was not designed for that ""it is a pen tool not a mouse or track pad""
The flip stand is very solid and is secure when on a table, you do not even notice that it is not a laptop when using it in this configuration on a table.
The i3 processor with Intell graphics and 128Gb hard drive to me because of what I do professionally is a winner for me. I can use Photoshop CC and review images in adobe Bridge with the client on location and it all works seamlessly with not lag.
The heat off the alpha is good. Over the years I have gotten laptops as a cheep fix to processing images but have found that the heating of the processor and all the other components shorten the life of the machine. I did a test on the alpha and ran it in photoshop CC for 2 hours processing 128MB raw files ""which is quite taxing"" and to the touch the alpha was hot but not uncomfortable. It is liquid cooled so the heat escapes more evenly at the back of the device. But I still would not use this for processing or heavy work.

The screen out of the box compared to the competition is not as good ""which is an IPS screen, ""IPS screens were invented in the late 1980s"". It is a very bright screen with nearly 400nits of brightness if needed, so outside it looks great. It has a lot of reflection, so I got a screen protector which reduced the reflection by 50%. Color accuracy and gamut is OK, for a photographer not great but OK. I calibrated the screen with a datacolor spyder 4 elite colorometer and it scored well in sRGB ""93%"" which is great for designers and art directors the majority who work in sRGB color profile"". So for just reviewing images and basic color correction it is perfect. For adobe 1998 color profile which photographers use it scored ""70%"" which is good for IPS panel screens but for professional retouch and photography color correcting not so good. I have put images of the final calibration so you can see for yourself the results.
The keyboard, I know I put it as a pro but there is one thing that bugs me but because you can touch the screen it is not a big issue. The touch pad on the keyboard has one problem, I have a problem sometimes placing the courser as I type. As I am typing this review I instinctively use the touch pad to back track and I find it is not intuitive enough to place it perfectly where I want it, so I use my finger and it is all OK again.
The battery, compared to the competition is OK. I get 5 hours constant use before it goes into power save mode, but I use it for watching video, web browsing to some image reviewing and photoshop work.

So in conclusion I am very happy with the acre switch alpha 12 with i3processor 128GB memory. If you are a designer and need something for light work and for reviewing with clients or just a collage student. After you calibrate the screen it is pretty good and I would question buying the windows surface book as a result. Hope this helps:)

B01KHTMXNK,Amazon Customer,4.0,We purchased 2 of these 2-in-1s so that we could access these systems more easily than from a phone app,22 September 2017,the United Kingdom,False,"As a business we recently change over to a paperless job management and accountancy software system. We purchased 2 of these 2-in-1s so that we could access these systems more easily than from a phone app. They are just what we needed as a small business for site work. Accessing service manuals and drawings is so much better than from a phablet. We thought a 12"" screen might be too large, but it is perfect for our needs.. The only minor criticism is that the keyboard flexes a little if it it is used on the lap; this can occasionally operate the trackpad switches. So far so good and no complaints. Portable and useful and makes site work so much easier than using a 5.7"" phablet.",8

B01KHTMXNK,Mr M J McNamara,5.0,Well worth considering as a viable Surface alternative,12 November 2016,the United Kingdom,False,"Acer Switch Alpha 12
Looking for a replacement for my faithful, but suddenly dead Linx 10 I had been exploring options for a Surface – with a view to increasing both screen and RAM size. I then came across the Acer Switch Alpha 12.
12” Windows 10 tablet, Intel i3 2.3GHz, 4GB RAM and 128Gb SSD, complete with backlit keyboard and pen; and all for under £600. This is similar spec to the mid range Surface 3 or lower range Surface 4 but with a significantly lower price, especially when you take into account the included keyboard and pen.
First impressions are very positive. A solid and professional brushed aluminium build, keyboard with definite travel and positive feel to the keys and the bonus of completely silent running given that the tablet is Liquid Cooled. The kick-stand clips back with a positive snap and is designed to allow you to set to any angle you like, and the rubber cover along the bar means there of no risk of it slipping in use – which even works when it’s on your knees. The full sized USB 3 socket is a major boon, removing the need for a mini-USB adaptor but, so far, the USB-C connector has presented a problem. I have been looking to get the ‘optional’ USB-C cable but so far to no avail. Something I think Acer need to address and either include with the unit, or provide clear details on a compatible brand. I have so far tried 3 and none have worked – either for Data or Power!
The ASA12 powers up in seconds and runs very smoothly. The screen is bright, crisp and very responsive and, while there is a fair amount of pre-installed bloatware, this is all easily removed for those of us that don’t want it. I like the Windows button on the side of the unit, under the controls for volume, but would also like to have the ‘on-screen’ option too. I think Acer missed a trick here in not having their Logo play that role, although this is covered when the keyboard is attached in its sloped position.
Neither of the cameras are particularly brilliant, but only a problem if you want to use the tablet for any level of quality image capture as the screen resolution and colour range is more than acceptable for displaying photos or video. However, I am a bit disappointed with the sound quality – all a bit tinny and weak. Not a unit for playing your favourite tunes.
Some reports indicated that there may be issues with battery life and I would agree that it is not the best. However, as I am not looking to use for long periods away from any access to power, this is really not an issue for me. I was however a little stunned by the charger unit, which is more laptop than tablet size. Again, the issue of a compatible USB-C cable needs to be resolved.
Overall, I like this tablet very much. Solid, profession feeling construction, good specification level, although there may be issues in battery life if you’re a heavy on-the-move user, and all for a competitive price.

Sadly the graphics kept freezing and restarting laptop randomly.

I carried out a standard component bench test to check the integrity of the hardware.
Sadly it was nowhere near my colleagues results and they have much lower spec laptops.

The Graphics test even stated that the graphics card was at RTX 2060s score not the actual RTX4070 that is installed. Ill do more testing in future when I have time and feedback. SEE PICS!

As a busy engineer I waited 1 month for delivery and cant wait another month to send it back so it will likely be stored for component salvage. Shame

Hey! If the seller reads this ...... feel free to comment and give an explanation. I would genuinely like to know why the bench tests fail the way they have.

I have never seen that exact failure and I have tested a lot of laptops with varying specification components.

As a busy engineer I waited 1 month for delivery and cant wait another month to send it back so it will likely be stored for component salvage. Shame

Hey! If the seller reads this ...... feel free to comment and give an explanation. I would genuinely like to know why the bench tests fail the way they have.

The keyboard is large and spacious, and doesn’t feel cramped at all when I’m typing (though I have quite large hands). Recreationally, it’s also top of the line!

B0F1ZTKLDQ,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,22 April 2025,the United States,False,"All is as advertised! Came in the time frame posted. Looks good, all ports work, all specs are accurate per the system settings.

This is my first laptop after years of building and using desktops. This one does have a heat fan but be aware that the thing does get hot. While playing fortnite at all low settings the temp coming out of the exhaust was hitting 110F and higher, but the game performed good enough, FPS stayed over 40. Having played games on PC for many years, I'd say thats perfectly acceptable for a laptop in this price range, especially considering this isn't truly meant for that kind of action.

I was skeptical of Mallrace as I just got done dealing with a bad situation with NIMO, but this seller looks legit. The case material is very lightweight. There's more flex in it than I'd like but again, it's a cost effective product, so that's forgivable. Keyboard works great, good click feel. Quick startup, less than 30 seconds. All apps seem to open and close pretty quickly. No bloatware, good enough speakers, quick Bluetooth connection.

Altogether a good buy. I might give it a few weeks and come back to add info but for now, I'd recommend Mallrace to anyone.

First I am happy to say this had one of the cleanest windows 11 installs I have encountered, no bloatware or unnecessary shovel ware were installed, so that saved me considerable time getting it set up for her.

The system boots reasonably fast and has a sharp clear looking screen with good brightness levels. Spec wise this should be perfect for anyone who needs it to do basic work, consume media and browse the net.

Regardless of advertising this is not going to be a great gaming laptop, it should be able to handle some light gaming such as adventure games, anything sprite based or something like Minecraft but don't expect this to handle something like Skyrim or Cyberpunk.

For anyone interested AOC is a fairly well known brand who markets everything from monitors to mini pc's. This specific laptop is also marketed under the AceMagic (model AX15) brand name with the exact same specs and depending on the listing that version could be a bit cheaper. So I would search Amazon and look for the best deal/seller. I went with this one as I wanted one shipped by Amazon in case I encountered any issues.

The screen is crisp, the metal body feels premium, and it’s lightweight enough to carry around easily. Love the modern ports, especially the Type-C. For the price, this is a fantastic personal laptop. Highly recommend!",0
B0F1XL6538,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,21 April 2025,the United States,False,"I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the AOC laptop! This machine delivers incredible performance for its price range. Powered by the N97 processor (far superior to Celeron or Pentium options), it handles everything I throw at it with ease. From multitasking between documents and web tabs to launching resource-heavy apps, it runs smooth as butter with its 16GB DDR4 RAM and ultra-fast 512GB SSD.

One of the biggest surprises is how capable it is for gaming! I regularly play my Steam library, including my go-to RC flight simulator, RealFlight Evolution, learning to fly 3d airplane and it runs flawlessly. The integrated GPU handles it all without a hitch, making this a solid option for casual gamers as well.

The 15.6"" FHD IPS screen is absolutely stunning—sharp, vibrant, and ideal for both productivity and content creation. The slim bezels and lightweight, metal design give it a premium feel, and I love how easily it fits into my backpack.

Connectivity is top-notch too, with every port I need and Bluetooth 5.0 + WiFi5 for seamless device pairing and fast transfers. The battery life has also impressed me—lasting through my work sessions and then some.

Plus, the customer service and pre-shipment testing give me peace of mind. AOC clearly stands behind its products.

If you're looking for a powerful, affordable, and stylish laptop that can handle work, multitasking, and even gaming—this is it. Highly recommended!

B0DTPK8PFH,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,25 March 2025,the United States,False,"Ordered this as I needed a PC to run one specific, light footprint program (I am a Mac user so...typically no Windows for me). Since I really needed it for JUST this one purpose, I was looking for something that was simple to use, had enough processing power for running the tasks I needed it to, and is small, portable and reliable. All while not costing a small fortune, of course.

This laptop fits that bill and then some! It's nicely built so it feels sturdy - a lot of ""budget"" laptops do not, so I wanted to make sure I pointed that out. It is very easy to set up - walks you through everything, so you can get up and running in maybe 15-20 minutes tops. It's uncomplicated - comes with just what you need and nothing you don't - so an instruction booklet, the laptop itself, and a power cord. The screen is nice resolution - very bright so I have no doubt it really is 1080p - it has a nice amount of RAM onboard so you can most definitely run things like the Microsoft Office suite (including Outlook) with ease. It connects to the internet easily too so you can use it for browsing, shopping, and anything you would use your phone for, just bigger. The graphics are bright and vibrant, and with 15.6"" of screen real estate, it makes for a display that lets you get a LOT done with minimal eyestrain or screen fatigue.

It does very well with multi-tasking which is fantastic - I opened a number of things and switched between as a test...no issues with lagging or latency whatsoever. In fact, it was impressive for a lower priced laptop!

Overall, this laptop is a great deal for anyone who needs a PC for school, seniors who want to use the internet and Word to write letters or keep track of household stuff, a work from home individual who uses Office for most things...really the capabilities are even beyond what the casual to mid-grade typical computer user would need, but this is surely the audience the seller is going for based on price and build/style.

While the graphics card is nice and renders well, I don't know that I would use it for gaming or video editing, but that's simply because you realistically need more RAM than this to do that without lagging. The laptop itself would likely otherwise keep up fine as the video card is very speedy. You CAN definitely play games on this too, though, and provided they are not super high resolution, fast moving first person shooters where you can't have a second of latency or you're cooked, you will be more than fine.

Battery life is VERY good - it comes charged and ready to go. I let it drain on first use to see how long it would take to top back off - less than an hour and it was fully charged and ready to go - giving about 8 hours of use before needing to be topped off again. Not bad!!

For the price, which is extremely reasonable given the quality and capability of this laptop, you really cannot beat this - it's probably all you'll need for productivity and much more. I highly recommend this - would buy it for my own mother who pretty much hates technology, and if that's not a solid endorsement, then I don't know what is :)

B0DTPDMR2Z,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,30 April 2025,the United States,False,"This laptop has a huge screen, although 1080p is not as high resolution as you would expect on a screen that big these days. It is a nice screen though, crisp enough and easy to read. The cpu performs well enough for basic tasks, and 16G of ram is plenty. The keyboard is annoying, with the spacing being just off enough that I keep hitting wrong keys. That said, having a full number pad available is a nice addition.
The only major issue is that it does not have USB-C charging. You have to carry a wall wart instead. Overall, this is a good second laptop. The screen is readable and bright, the keyboard is complete and it has a bunch of USB ports.",0

For it's current price as of this review ($759.99), I would expect a much better CPU and some dedicated graphics. This is priced at about twice what it's worth.
It was easy to setup and works good though. We use it for surfing the web while watch tv.
The battery is pretty good, but then again, with the weaker cpu and graphics... it should last a while.

Out of the box, I turned it on and was immediately asked for a password for a “user01” and nothing in the tiny manual and documentation to provide the password. It was like it had been used before. In order to make it functional, I had to restore it to factory settings before I got to a screen that I could actually log in to. It was annoying, frustrating, and infuriating.

The computer did better after we got it going . It took a while, but it loaded and is running steam with Sid Meier’s Civ 3, and Duck-Duck-Go. Searches are quick.

I wish the brightness would adjust lower. The keyboard feels good – nice travel, with a satisfying [but not too loud] snick when it engages. Smooth action, but when you use a key, you know it. The screen is sharp and clear.

It’s light for its size, and feels substantial, but not heavy. It has a thick plastic rib on the bottom, giving it necessary strength and rigidity. I think this will help it wear well.

Have gotten used to back-lighted keys, in my old age. This doesn’t have them, but I’m enjoying the computer, nonetheless.

It also has a decent battery life.

B0DT92JMZL,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,29 March 2025,the United States,False,"I've never tried one of these mini computers before and I have to say, it's great! I needed a dedicated computer closer to my 3D printers in the basement and didn't want to spend the $$$ for another laptop. I had numerous monitors laying around, so when I saw this on sale for a little over $100 I thought I'd give it a try.

It's AWESOME. It's got built in wifi and Bluetooth, so my mouse and keyboard are wireless. I ran an ethernet cable to it and my download/upload speeds are over 800mbps.

I only use it to slice .gcode files, which this machine does almost as well as my $1,600 laptop!! Just a tad slower, but only by a few seconds.

I don't do gaming, so I don't need a multi-core speed demon, so this was a perfect match for my 3D Printing computer needs.

I added a 2TB 2.5"" SSD to store all my printer files. Use Bluetooth speaker to play music and I have a thermal shipping table hooked up via USB port and I can print to all my wireless printers too.

It does everything I wanted it to do and more.

Who thought I could add another complete computer system using peripherals I already had laying around for less than $105?

It's running Windows 11 Home Pro, which is compatible with all my software and hardware too.

Super easy to set up. Just like buying a new laptop.

If you are going to add a drive, you will need to know how to partition and assign a drive letter, so learn that before you add a drive and wonder why you can see it in the hardware manager but can't see it in ""My Computer""!

I think Ill buy another one just in case I need a backup!

Need another computer? This might be a great option for you! It sure was for me!

B0DSJ4T3WX,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,23 April 2025,the United States,False,"This Jumper laptop has completely exceeded my expectations! The 16-inch FHD IPS 1920x1200 display with a 16:10 aspect ratio is super sharp and provides extra vertical space that’s great for reading, spreadsheets, and multitasking. It's perfect for both work and casual use.

With 16GB RAM and a generous 1152GB of storage, it runs incredibly smooth—even when I have lots of browser tabs and Office 365 apps open at once. The 12th Gen N95 processor (up to 3.4GHz) handles daily tasks effortlessly, and the included Office 365 subscription is a fantastic bonus for productivity.

The dual speakers provide clear audio for calls and streaming, and the Mini HDMI makes it easy to connect to an external monitor for extended displays. Battery life from the 38WH battery gets me through most of the day without needing a recharge.

The laptop runs fast, 16GB RAM really helps with switching between apps and browser tabs. I can easily work in Docs, answer emails, and hop into a Zoom call without the fan going crazy or anything lagging.
The screen is one of my favorite parts. It’s a 16 inch display, it feels roomy, especially for spreadsheets and web browsing. It’s clear, bright, and the colors look good enough for casual streaming. I’ve watched some videos in the evenings, and the picture quality is good. The speakers are ok, fine for watching videos or background music, but if you’re picky about sound, you might want an extra Bluetooth soundbar. What also stood out to me is the storage. It has plenty of storage, which is way more than I need, but I like not having to worry about running out of space.
The keyboard’s actually pretty comfortable to type on, even when I’m working for a few hours straight. The webcam is pretty standard, but it works fine for Zoom or Teams calls. Battery life is decent too. On a full charge, it usually lasts me through most of the workday without needing to plug in. I keep the screen brightness at around 60%, and that seems to help it stretch a bit longer.
Overall, if you just need something reliable for working from home, browsing, hopping on video calls, or even watching a show or two in the evening, this one’s a solid pick.

B0DRVLR3V4,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,10 April 2025,the United States,False,"I have over 15 computers at home, and am an avid computer user with Windows, Mac, Linux and ChromeOS devices. I saw this and was intrigued to get this because this would allow me to create a simple FydeOS based device for cheap. Unfortunately, this device has way too many issues and suffers from a general apathy from the designers to make a good product. let's cover everything:

1. This comes with Windows 11 Pro. Yes, a $150 device with Windows Pro would have been a steal. In usual scenarios.
2. The RAM is 6 GB against the listed 8 GB. 8 GB is just the bare minimum you should have to have the device as usable and this runs short. I didn't open the device to see if that is replaceable by any chance. (Update: SSD is but RAM isn't).
3. The resolution is HD and not Full HD 1920 X 1080 as listed in the page.
4. My device came with Wi-Fi turned off. The designers decided not to include a keyboard shortcut to turn Wifi on or off, even though it has shortcuts to turn the trackpad on or off or for media playback. Not sure how often people turn their trackpads off and most media players have shortcuts anyway. I attached an external wifi adapter to install it properly as I didn't want to install it offline and then fix that and update it later.
5. No keyboard shortcuts for brightness up or down. That is one of the most used shortcuts. Again, these are strange design choices.
6 No USB-C, even though the listing states USB-C-based video output. I don't know how anyone can have that many listing mistakes/issues. It uses a proprietary barrel charger. Why spend effort and money building a custom charger and not just give a USB-C port and allow users to use their own chargers if preferred?

No keyboard backlight either, though I don't expect that on a device at this price point. The device could be much better without additional development costs but is hampered immensely by the choices made by the designers. If the device matched the specs, I would have rated it highly, 4-5 stars, as the price for that device is amazing, but it seems to be rendered unusable by multiple shortcuts taken.
Will install fydeOS on it and hopefully it would work a bit faster and can live with 6GB or RAM

B0DQ8DJTH4,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,22 January 2025,the United States,False,"Overall, this has been a good choice for everyday use. It comes with decent specs such as 16GB of DDR4 memory which is advertised to be expandable, as well as a 512GB solid state drive, which I assume is an M.2 NVMe (hopefully not SATA) drive, which is also replaceable/expandable, though would require reinstalling the OS. I am not sure if there's an additional slot for a 2.5"" or M.2 drive, as I didn't want to open it up and void the warranty. It has all the normal desired features like a 1080p FHD display, near full backlit keyboard, multiple USB-A 2, 2.1, 3.0 and USB-C ports, card reader, combo audio jack, USB-C 65W (If I remember correctly) charging, HDMI out, 802.11ac (2.4GHz and 5GHz) wi-fi, and Bluetooth. It's ready to go out of the box with Windows 11 installed, so go through the setup and it's ready. I didn't notice any bloatware installed either which is a huge difference from mainstream computer retailers. The body feels solid, like at least the lower half is made of aluminum akin to MacBooks and higher-end consumer laptops. However, it's thin and lightweight still. I'm not a fan of the body's finish, as historically similar laptops I've had have been very easy to scratch and unfortunately it may be hard to find any sort of protective shell for this.

Ideal for:
-Students
-Small business
-Everyday use (email, office apps, web browsing)
-Lightweight/hobby tasks (photo/video editing, music production, simple rendering)
-Leisure (streaming music, shows, movies, casual games)

Not ideal for:
-Performance gaming
-High-load processing, rendering
-Extensive video/photo editing

B0DQ8DJTH4,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,24 March 2025,the United States,False,"I was under the impression that this had a dedicated graphics card, but it does not—which makes the price completely unjustifiable EVEN ON DISCOUNT (70%) off. I tried running a game for 20 minutes, and it was an absolute disaster. Even on the lowest settings with FSR upscaling (resolution set to around 1220x725), the performance was unbearable—averaging 14 FPS and feeling like slow-motion. This is supposed to be a “semi-gaming PC,” yet it struggles even on the most minimal settings.

On top of that, the screen has major quality control issues. Right out of the box, there were pressure spots on the corners, creating bright patches that are impossible to ignore.

While the CPU did reach 4.3GHz, which is decent, it doesn’t make up for the fact that this laptop can’t handle gaming, video editing, or anything remotely demanding. And if you do push the CPU, the battery life becomes absolutely atrocious. Expect to be plugged in constantly if you want to use it at full performance.

The sound quality is terrible—like listening through cheap earbuds wrapped in a toilet paper roll. It’s muffled, hollow, and lacks any depth or clarity.

Overall, this laptop feels misleadingly marketed, overpriced, and underpowered for anything beyond basic tasks. If you’re looking for gaming or creative work, stay far away from this.

B0DN1MNBPK,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,11 February 2025,the United States,False,"I purchased this a few weeks ago for under $400, and at that price, I think this laptop provides great value.

The body is powder-coated aluminum and and the logo is sleek and nondescript. As far as looks go, there is nothing to reveal that this is a budget device, and will be suitable for an office setting. Build quality is quite a bit higher than I would have expected for the price, and comes preinstalled with Windows 11 Home Edition.

The 1920x1080 screen gets bright enough for a well-lit office. The keyboard has a numpad and full-sized arrows keys condensed together, and is an otherwise typical chiclet-style scissor-switch keyboard. The camera and speakers are unremarkable, which is expected at this price point. The trackpad is oversized and may be to some people's particular liking. It has three USB-A ports, a USB-C port, HDMI, 3.5mm audio jack, and a TF card reader.

The processor is an Intel N97, a decent low-power workhorse with not-terrible graphics (though nowhere close to a dedicated graphics card). It also has 16GB of RAM, a 500 GB hard drive, 38Wh battery, WiFi5 and BT5.0, and shipped with a ~40W barrel jack power adapter.

Given its decent build quality, unassuming looks, modest functionality, bloat-free Windows installation, and low price, I'm giving it five stars.

The big screen is great and it's lightweight and easy to transport around. After opening it and charging to full, it turned on smoothly and it was very easy to setup straight out of the box without any extra hassle.

Besides the benefit of a large screen, it also has every port you'll ever need! It can handle lots of different types of plugin attachments including USB, USB-C, HDMI, SD card slot and audio jack. Used all the different plugin slots when transferring data over from my last computer and it handled everything really well.

All in all, I'm very happy with this laptops performance and physical features including being rather thin and quite light. Moreover, I picked it up on sale for $399 - truly unbeatable. This one's definitely worth a try.",0
B0DKJK6N1C,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,12 December 2024,the United States,False,"This laptop has been a great addition to my workspace. It’s fast, reliable, and handles multitasking with ease. Setting it up was simple, and transferring my files from my old device only took a couple of hours. The laptop didn’t slow down or struggle during the process, which left a solid first impression.

The 17.3-inch screen is sharp and clear, with vibrant colors and plenty of space to work comfortably. Whether I’m reading, browsing, or working on documents, the display feels immersive without being overwhelming. I also appreciate the lightweight design and slim bezels, which make it easy to carry around.

Performance-wise, the 12th generation Alder Lake processor, combined with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, ensures everything runs smoothly. From handling multiple browser tabs to running office software, it hasn’t let me down. I even set up a triple monitor extender, and the laptop handled it without any hiccups. It’s definitely built for productivity.

Battery life is decent, lasting around five hours, which is fine for my day to day use. The cooling system works quietly and effectively, keeping the laptop from overheating even during longer sessions. I also like the metal casing, which adds a sturdy feel, though I did notice the hinge is plastic. It seems durable for now, but it’s something I’ll keep an eye on.

Connectivity options are plentiful, with HDMI, USB ports, USB-C, and a headphone jack, making it easy to connect peripherals or charge on the go. The keyboard is comfortable for typing, even during long hours, and the trackpad feels responsive. The built in speakers are decent but nothing extraordinary, so I usually use headphones for better audio quality.

Overall, this laptop has been a dependable choice for daily tasks like office work, web browsing, and streaming. It’s not designed for heavy duty activities like gaming or video editing, but for everyday use, it’s perfect. If you’re looking for a high performing yet affordable laptop with a large screen and plenty of features, this one is worth considering.

B0DKDV6QS6,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,17 December 2024,the United States,False,"So far so good with this laptop, that I bought for the Black Friday sale price, which I thought a good deal. It's not super fancy, but it works well so far, other than when I spilled a little bit of my drink on it and had to take it apart to dry it out, as the mouse pad got wet underneath and wouldn't function correctly until dried. Disassembly was fairly easy, just flip it over, remove all of the screws (keeping track of the two longer screws at the back corners), and gently pry off the bottom, the drive and memory are easily accessed with the bottom cover removed. I removed the windows drive, which I upgraded to a new drive [Silicon Power 1TB A55 M.2 SSD SATA III Internal Solid State Drive 2280 SU001TBSS3A55M28AB,] and the RAM, which I upgraded to [Corsair Vengeance SODIMM 32GB (1x32GB) DDR4 2666 C18 1.2V for Intel 9th & 10th Gen Systems, Black], both of which are working great. To enter BIOS I found that you have to start hitting the [Esc] key as soon as the power light comes on, there you can adjust your settings, to include booting from USB installation media. I installed Linux Mint 22 Cinnamon, which is running beautifully so far. About the only other thing I can think of is that the keyboard isn't back-lit, which is okay because i can see it clearly from the light of the big screen, which is nice, and the sound doesn't have much volume, but it doesn't affect me, as I have external speakers that I use when needed. So all in all, I'm very satisfied with this laptop so far. I'd also like to add that I really like the rubber pads on the bottom, they're no slip, heavy duty, and work great, the back one runs the whole length and the two front ones are sizable, great design feature.

B0DKDV6QS6,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 November 2024,the United States,False,This Laptop got HDMI and three usb ports. It is super convenience to me. I don’t need to find another cord to transport my USB drivers. My Apple are no longer carrying the USB port which is super hard for me to recording my music by using an USB microphone. Sometime the transport cord can’t get my USB microphones so I have to unplug and plug in for several times in order to let the computer to get it. This build in USB ports save me a lot of times. The starting speed is also very good. Don’t need to take too long to start it. The best thing of this laptop is the size of the screen. Our family can look at movies by using this laptop.

The computer has very little storage and memory space. I tried to upgrade the OS, which it is telling me to do, but I need an external hard drive as there's very little disk space to do so. What's taking up disk space? Of the 50GB-ish that comes with the laptop (not even 64), 50% of that is taken up by system required stuff. The remaining is other and apps and documents.

Then, I wasn't aware of this but with windows OS 10 S, you can only download apps that are on the Microsoft app store. Chrome is gone, Dropbox isn't there, adobe acrobat isn't there.

B0DFLWQQT2,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,21 May 2024,the United States,False,"A long-awaited upgrade so I can finally dive into 3D graphics, which has been an elusive dream due to financial constraints until recently. This was no trivial purchase, and I was keen to use the performance it had to offer.

So, I was worried when I received the package...and every single tamper seal had been cut and retaped, three with 'replacement' tamper tape, but the final box just with a clear circular piece of tape (see photos). Outwardly, the S/N matched with the system contained within, and firing it up, the system requirements matched what I ordered. Still, I'm not pleased that the seller (Delca) has brushed aside my concerns about why the tamper seals were cut. I'm concerned that if the system has been tampered with or modified, any warranty could be useless, so I want to know.

The machine itself haven't been acting up YET, so I would say it works for its purposes there. And my only really concern with the machine directly is the rather flimsy screen, something that feels like it can be twisted and broken with little effort. The system is a little heavy and the power adapter is huge, but I don't plan on traveling much with it, so it not much of a drawback for me. The graphics and speed are just what I've been wanting to do some real 3D work after years of being restricted to budget computers. with no such performance.

As for the seller though, they aren't impressing me. As much as I paid, I'm glad I resisted the urge to spend more.

Es la lap más completa y rápida que he tenido.

Dudas que me surgieron antes de comprar:

Teclado retroiluminado: Si (2 niveles de intensidad)
Huella táctil en botón de encendido: Si
Pantalla: 14"" para interiores tiene buen desempeño, para exterior si queda a deber, pero funciona bien.
Procesador: Ryzen 5 5500U
RAM: 8 GB (4 soldadas a la placa y un slot con 4 más) Soporta hasta 20 GB
Teclado: en inglés, aunque se configura a español
Color: Azul
El cuerpo de la lap es plástico, aunque da la apariencia de ser aluminio, pero es de buena calidad.
El modelo exacto es: IdeaPad 3 14ALC6
SSD: 254 GB
2 puertos USB
1 HDMI
1 Ranura para tarjetas de memoria SD
1 Puerto Tipo C
1 conector 3.5 para audífonos

Me costó 12 000 (a 12 MSI, pero se puede hasta 18 con algunas tarjetas) pagando el envío rápido y me regresaron 120 de los gastos de importación, prácticamente lo que me costó el envío rápido. He visto reseñas de personas que les llega solo la caja y adentro leche, paquetes de hojas, piedras, supongo que en la paquetería se las roban, lo aconsejable es hacer un video del unboxing para tener evidencia en caso de que les pase algo así, en este sentido recomiendo pagar el envío rápido, a mi me llegó por UPS, creo que es más seguro.

En conclusión, es una lap muy buena, muy rápida y por el precio difícilmente van a encontrar una similar por debajo de los 15 mil. Lo que extraño en mi caso es la pantalla de 15"" estaba acostumbrado a mi lap anterior con pantalla más grande y un puerto USB más estaría perfecto.

Three things right out the gate: 1) It's listed as Abyss Blue but it's actually a silver/metallic color which I'm not angry about because it looks good. 2) It's listed as 14"" but it's actually 15.6"" which again I'm not angry about lol 3) It's stated as Windows 10 Home for the operating system but it comes with Windows 11 which this is my first time using the OS and I haven't run into any issues with it so once again I'm not angry!

Now onto the rest: I read a review in which their laptop didn't have the correct graphics card in it. I can confirm mine does indeed have the 6 core, 12 thread AMD Ryzen 5 5500U. In fact, everything else is as stated in the description and it's wonderful! It is quick to start up and all programs so far run quickly. I haven't tried playing a newer game on it yet so that will be the biggest test for this laptop that I would be able to put it through. Otherwise, it operates the web and my usual desktop applications perfectly fine.

The few negatives I have: 1) The sound is not the best as the speakers are inside the elbow where the screen meets the body. 2) Even though the keyboard has a full ten key pad, the enter key is small and I find my finger hitting the 4 key rather than the enter some times (just have to learn this keyboard better) 3) The battery life seems decent. I'm taxing this system more than I am my work laptop, but it still seems to drain slightly faster than I expect.

Overall I'm very happy I got this laptop so far as it has exceeded my expectations at pretty much every turn.

Speed: 3 Stars

I’ve had this laptop for about a month now, and I have been using it almost daily, I am somewhat disappointed by this laptop. Since it has twice the RAM of my former laptop, I expected to see a significant increase in speed, but I haven’t. It works about the same as my laptop with 16 GB of RAM. It is pretty slow to download and upload. It is slower than my older laptop when it comes to downloads, so I know it’s the laptop, and not the internet connection. Also, the computer is pretty slow at transferring files. It took forever to get all my files off my external hard drive and onto the computer. Granted, it was over 10,000 files. But, there was no noticeable difference in speed from my old laptop, in spite of this one having better specs (More RAM, and, in theory, a faster processor). Disappointed that I didn’t see a marked increase in performance considering the upgrade in specifications.
That being said, the laptop works fine for normal work functions. I can have several programs open at once without it slowing the laptop down. Searching the internet works fine. I don’t have any buffering issues when streaming media.

Sound & Features: 4 Stars

The sound quality is pretty good. It’s not perfect- not a lot of bass, but only slightly tinny. The speakers get up fairly loud- my comfortable level of listening at close range is about halfway up the volume bar. So, you can get the sound across your living room if you are trying to show something to a crowd. The computer has two USB ports which both work well, plus a USB C end, so you can charge your phone directly from the computer.
The power cord doesn’t plug in easily. You kind of have to wiggle and shove. Pretty sure that the charging port is what will break first. There is no place to plug in a micro SD card, or an adapter for one.
The video quality is pretty good. No complaints there. The laptop is lightweight, and thin- it fits easily into a backpack. There is the additional, smaller number pad on the side, which is useful for some- kind of a waste of space for me. However, the keyboard is still spacious enough to type comfortably. I have to exert a little more pressure than I’d like to press the keys, such that long periods of typing do hurt my fingers.
Brand new, out of the box, the battery is lasting for about 5-6 hours before needing a recharge. It takes probably 3-4 hours to charge back up, if you aren’t currently using it- a little longer if you are charging while using it.
What I don’t like (buckle up, here comes the soap box):

Setup: 1 Star

Setup for this laptop was a pain in the booty. Plan on taking about an hour for setup. The computer has to restart several times. Also, you can’t set up the laptop without an internet connection. Maybe there is some workaround for the computer-savvy who can get into the inner workings of the computer, but for the layman, there is no option to “skip” and finish setting up your PC without the internet. No internet, not able to start the laptop for the first time.
Microsoft getting in your business: 1 Star
The laptop also requires you to sign into a Microsoft account in order to set up the computer. You can’t even get to the desktop without signing in. There used to be an option to set up the laptop with a local account. That option has been removed. Again, maybe there’s some secret code for computer-whisperers, but the rest of us are stuck with the garbage options they give you. Even worse, once you sign into your Microsoft account the computer will, automatically, and without asking you, start backing up all your files to your OneDrive. I transferred my files to this laptop, and, the next day got the dreaded “you’re out of storage” for my Microsoft account. It had started backing up all my files, again, without my knowledge or consent, and completely filled up my One Drive. To add insult to injury, it automatically “syncs” your One Drive and your computer. So, when I started rage-deleting all the stuff it had uploaded to my One Drive, so I could send an email, IT DELETED THOSE FILES FROM MY LAPTOP. Again, there was no warning that you were deleting the file everywhere. Lucky for me, I still had copies of my files on an external hard drive.
But, you should know that this laptop is thoroughly in Microsoft’s pocket. Create yourself a dummy MS account and set up the laptop with that account. As soon as you get into the laptop for the first time, unlink the PC from your Microsoft account. After that, you can go ahead and sign in with your regular account, if you want.

Software: 2 Stars

As far as the software, this comes with Windows 11, just the basic. If you want any of the Office software, video players, or image editors, (besides paint) you have to pay for the subscription for those separately. This comes with a pre-installed version of Windows Defender, but you will probably also need to download your own virus software on it.
As a side note, the search feature stinks. Trying to find one of your files? Good luck.

Overall: 4 Stars for the laptop, 1 Star for Microsoft

My overall impression is that this is a decent laptop for the price. It is not impressive, it will likely not last more than a couple of years, but it will function for basic stuff, and it comes at a relatively cheap price (currently priced at $399.00, in April of 2025). So, this laptop is worth it for students, household use, a small business, or as an alternate laptop. It is lacking in speed if you need it for serious gaming, video editing, or anything that requires more heavy-duty functionality.

B0DBYTS8GF,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,27 April 2025,the United States,False,"I will never ever buy any Lenovo laptop ever again. I boycotted two brands for my 20+ years of tech experience. I had no regrets. This is going to be the third. Today, in the middle of the 3rd decade of the 21st century upgrading ssd or adding memory supposed to be easier than anything. But not with Lenovo brand. It takes special tools and even screws are not the same size. It is a giant pain and limits me, as a consumer in the usage of the product I paid for. Obviously I figured the way, but I will never buy Lenovo laptop again (at least until they advertise how EASY to replace the cheap windows ssd it comes with.) SHAME ON LENOVO.

Another con is a required internet connection right at the first start (this is one of the reasons I will never use windows 10-11. They spy on you.) Lenovo, just like any other brand has a certain type of licence of the operating system they pre install on their products. They could have changed that - what if I want this laptop for my ""secret documents"" only? I don't want it to get online.

B0DBYLG4LZ,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,17 December 2024,the United States,False,"Thinking back to the beginning of when laptops came out, this is just an amazing product of the evolution of technology. Lenovo has continued to bring the type of keyboard and trackpoint that IBM started to great effect. The trackpoint really is a huge deal for anybody who has trained themselves to make use of it. The way it allows for a certain control of the mouse with your hands being kept to the keyboard is ingenious and I encourage anybody to really give it a try. Like with everything, you have to practice with it to have it become second nature but once it does it is a game changer. The build quality feels great. Thank you Lenovo for the amount of ports that you are able to put onto this device. The only thing missing for an all around engineering workhorse is an ethernet port but it makes sense that it can't be included due to how it would impact the size and weight which is what makes this laptop feel so good. I spent alot of time worrying about the OLED screen but after spending time with it, I have to say that it is truly worth it (and gorgeous) and Lenovo did a great job with the screen matte. Also very impressed with the quality of sound for a laptop. The performance is good and hopefully Intel can figure out how to make their chips even better in terms of performance vs battery life going forward. I am extremely happy with this laptop and think it definitely sets the benchmark for a productivity laptop for anyone who wants to stay in the Windows/Linux realm of x86.",0

B0DBYLG4LZ,Anonyme,2.0,Sans titre,25 January 2025,the United States,False,"This review is for a Lenovo Gen 12 Thinkpad X1 Carbon laptop sold by ChiefComputers. The listing describes the computer as new in unopened original packaging, but in fact it was used, and packaging was ripped. The original invoice for a buyer in California was included, with the buyer's name. That buyer apparently returned the laptop to Lenovo, as the inner box was addressed from Lenovo Returns to the seller. The seller addressed the outer box to me. The features did not match the description: for one thing, the keyboard was Latin-American instead of U.S. as pictured. While I can remap keys (including <> where left-shift should be), I can't remap the fact of a double-height, single-width return key. As I go back and forth with an external keyboard, I'm still making mistakes on return, | and \. The original buyer apparently purchased the computer in December 2024, because that is the start date on the ""one-year"" warranty. I lost just one month of the warranty, but I should have spent $500 more and bought the computer from Lenovo. Ad promised no-touch screen, but it's a touch screen, which runs the battery down faster.

Great for everything else you can throw at it too. The dedicated graphics are not upgradable but at least there are some! However the RAM is upgradable which is nice and will give it more snap for the future. The screen has a clear, colorful view even at an angle. Quiet backlit keyboard with brightness levels make easy work in dimly lit situations. If you want to play graphic intense multi-player games from the last 3-5 years, look elsewhere, but if you play standard graphic games such as anything from Roblox and older games pre-2019 this will turn the trick for you.

B0D9NHYR82,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,16 April 2025,the United States,False,"For the price, this laptop gets a 5 star rating. Well, more like 4.5 but I couldn't give it that. It's a good sized laptop with a clear screen. It's pretty darn fast and it looks pretty sharp. Speakers are decent but not mind-blowing and for what it's worth, it has a camera, which is, again, passable, not mind-blowing. The keyboard on the one I got is more of a darker grey (it's advertised as ash grey, which I believe is a lighter color) but I actually like the darker keyboard better. Typing on the keyboard is pretty smooth too. It could use one or two more outlets on the sides though. You only get one USB Type-A port, one USB Type-C port and a headphone jack. Fine if you're more of a minimalist, but not ideal for multi-tasking work. Also, a little tip; When powering on, all you need to do is press the power button, NOT press and hold. I didn't realize that at first and thought initially that their was a problem. Just a piece of advice. Overall, it's a good laptop, at a fair price and should work well for the ""Average Joe"". I just got it, so the only question I have is, how long will it last? Hopefully it lasts me quite a while. But we'll see.

P.s. definitely would not use it on the street during the rain. This laptop is not going to withstand a drop from 3 ft on the hard surface. I mean not if it's open. And definitely not going to work properly if it is not totally ruined . But if used with care it will last you years no doubt

It came in the home safe mode, which probably any 12 year old can help you remove. Not having a twelve year around, I was able to remove the safe mode with a little bit of internet assistance. If you're getting it for a younger child, the safe mode is a plus, as it prevents downloading apps from non-vetted sources.

B0D97ZC61Y,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,24 August 2024,the United States,False,"I needed a laptop for work, since my old one broke, and having some history with Chromebooks and not liking those because their lack of compatibility, I went with a Windows laptop. I've had a 2-in-1 360° windows laptop in the past, so I was excited to see how it would compare, and it does well!

Now, it's not an *amazing* laptop; it comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB of internal storage, which is alright, but being honest, it may be a little difficult for my hobbies. For work, it's great! I can use Zoom and do whatever I need to do, has good account separation with Google (you can use separate Google Chrome openings, rather than having them all just in separate windows within one opening; look up Windows 11 Home Google Chrome if that doesn't make sense), and the audio and camera aren't bad! Video could be a little brighter but I won't complain; it does well even within the daylight.

I am an indie game developer, and although I didn't get the laptop specifically *for* my hobbies, it would've been nice to have more RAM, a stronger processor (it is i3), and more storage. I use Unity and I haven't been having any issues so far (loads everything up, downloads packages needed, opens projects and everything as it should) but it'll probably be slower then further I get into developing this current game. We shall see!

Overall, not bad. I usually don't do these but I just wanted to do a thorough review since no one else left one.

Oh! Also comes with a laptop carry bad, but the bag doesn't have handles. -10 points for that, you guys! Lol

B0D92BVMDT,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,29 April 2025,the United States,False,"This laptop is exactly what I wanted. All AMD and great performance. It chews through my video edits easily. I'm able to edit and play back 4k in realtime while editing, no problem. For gaming, I've so far tried BF 2042, Dirt Rally 2.0, World of Warcraft, and Spin Tires Mudrunner. It can handle them all at high or ultra settings and easily gets 140-170fps in each game.

I love that it has two USB-C ports and one that is 4.0. It makes gaming from an external drive totally feasible. The I/O is generally good. Some people point out the WiFi card as a weakness, but I've had no issues so far.

The stock 512gb drive is still running Win11. Nothing really was needed to set it up. Just turn it on and deal with the Windows BS and go.

I've installed a 2tb m.2 2280 NVME that's dedicated to Linux. Being all AMD, it runs great on Linux and that is where I spend most of my time. I'm using Fedora with no troubles. All the games listed above, except for BF2042 (thanks EA), I play on Fedora and it's awesome. I'm also doing most of my video and photo editing there. I wish the drive it came with was larger, but it's also easily replaceable if I decide to upgrade it.

Speaking of replacements, I upgraded it to 64gb of RAM immediately. That should be the max the CPU can handle, at 4800mt/s. Stock, it would heat the CPU up to around 95°C pretty frequently while gaming. After the new RAM, it rarely exceeds 90°C. I paired that with one of the cooling pads with a foam seal, single large fan, and filtered intake and the laptop now stays below 85°C no matter what. This should keep it running great for a long time.

Lastly, the screen and keyboard are pretty nice as well. The screen color is great and seems super accurate. Not the brightest screen ever, but plenty good for me (an upgrade from my ancient Alienware 17""). I like the ASUS chiclet keyboard, and really love having the numpad, the dedicated volume buttons above the F keys, and the basic backlighting.

B0D8CZ6JXZ,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,14 October 2024,the United States,False,"I bought this laptop during prime deal days. The product was shipped and delivered as expected, and I was super excited to begin using this laptop for homeschooling purposes. I ordered the 32GB Ram with 1Tb SSD with 500GB external hard drive. I did not receive the external hard drive that was promised in the listing. Instead, there was a card with a QR code on it for a link that implied that you should have added the external drive to your Amazon order in order to receive it with your order. I filled out the information that they asked for, but I still have not received a response from the seller.
When I opened up the laptop I was shocked at how flimsy it felt. Never the less, I continued with the set up process. After setting up the laptop, I went to the Lenovo website to register the it. This is where things began to get strange. The laptop's warranty had already started on 7/25/24. How was that possible? I then looked up the specs via the serial number on the Lenovo website. It stated that the laptop should have had 4GB Ram and 128GB SSD. I then checked how much storage was actually on the laptop. There was 32GB Ram and 1TB SSD installed. That would imply that the seller opened up the laptop and installed new Ram and SSD. This has in turn voided out the warranty. I researched this model and it was only meant to support a max of 16GB of Ram. And while having higher Ram installed would seem to be a good thing it could eventually lead to the system crashing in a short amount of time.

This is clearly a misrepresentation of the product. I do not trust this seller. How do I know what kind of ssd and Ram they put in this laptop. I requested a refund, but I will have to pay for the return shipping, and I will be charged a restocking fee.

I contacted Amazon to dispute the situation before I send the laptop back to the seller to ask them if they will refund the amount that the seller will charge for a restocking fee. They said that I have to wait to see what the seller does after I complete the return process. I will be sending it back tomorrow.

Do not buy this laptop. The company is buying cheap computers, changing out the components, and selling them as original from the manufacturer at a higher price than it is worth.

B0D82CBXW1,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,17 November 2024,the United States,False,"So this laptop is nice. It has a really sleek design and looks quite fancy out of the packaging. It comes with a pen and a holder that goes into one of the side ports so it really is convenient for on the go. The battery life so far is good and it does run really fast which is nice. But unfortunately there have been a few bugs and glitches that I’ve noticed, that started popping up within two weeks of me purchasing. I noticed that sometimes when exiting tablet mode the keyboard doesn’t work. I have to put the laptop back in tablet mode and then flip out of it for the keyboard to register my typing again. I also noticed that the touch screen keyboard glitches out when trying to type in the file explorer search bar. The pen sometimes stops writing mid stroke and frequently strokes get “stuck” in PowerPoint (they won’t erase and transfer across slides/ presentations; it’s only when I restart the laptop that they disappear but then the same problem happens again). I’m not sure if that issue is a lack of comparability between PowerPoint and Lenovo software because it happened on another Lenovo laptop of mine as well. Also sometimes when exiting tablet mode the screen will stay vertically flipped until I put the laptop to sleep and restart it. Sometimes the touch pad isn’t synced to my finger movements and the mouse lags behind on screen. Also, one time the screen glitched out profusely after some weird glitch involving the pen cursor. Anytime I would touch the pen to the screen, the cursor would start randomly pulsating throughout the corners of the screen; it’s hard to explain but it was unexpected and off putting.
Overall, I really wanted to love this laptop. It’s so sleek and again runs fast but these glitches are getting more frequent and I’ve only had it for less than a month. Unfortunately I don’t want to risk having further problems what with it already being buggy out of the box.

Unfortunately, within a month of use it had a crack in it's right hinge. It quickly became more and more problematic to use, so I ended up returning the item. Instead, I replaced it with another laptop with similar stats and similar cost, but at a different amazon link.

Imagine my surprise, when after returning this laptop, I come home to a new laptop that's EXACTLY THE SAME as the last one, box and charger alike. I tried to be a bit more cautious with how I used it, knowing that the right hinge was a bit weak. But unfortunately, within 3 months, the EXACT same crack appeared. Pretty much 1 month after Amazon's return window had closed.

I've had numerous laptops throughout my life, but NONE of them went to shit THIS quickly. I still have NUMEROUS old laptops that have lasted YEARS without damage to the physical casing. This poor level of quality is simply unacceptable.",0

Update: Laptop arrived today. Windows 11 no issue but this only has micro SD slot and I must have regular SD slot. Had some issues with connecting to our wireless internet. It found it then kept losing the connection. No other items have that issue - desktop or my 8-year old Acer. It was frustrating and not due to our router. Also, it was supposed to have 1TB of storage but where is it? This computer only showed c drive with 953 GB max.

I will keep you updated on return/refund process. You have to request a refund from the Seller and they are supposed to respond within 48 hours.

Love 'em, and can't live without the little nipple pointer (once you're used to it -- as a supplement to the trackpad and touch screen and external mouse -- it's hard to live without it). But they got rid of the physical buttons that used to be above the trackpad. I miss them; the haptic trackpad behavior isn't the same.

Also, they swapped the Fn and Ctrl keys compared to my older ThinkPad. That doesn't work for me; I've been able to handle Page Up/Down keys and other keys moved around, but Ctrl-at-my-left-pinky is hard-wired at this point. Luckily you can swap the keys in the BIOS. In theory you can also swap the keycaps, but I'm too chicken to do that -- one Youtuber remarked that it's possible to damage the switch. So I just stuck lablels over the Fn/Ctrl keys. If Lenovo intends the key caps to be swappable I wish they'd offer guidance on how to do that safely.

But these are relatively minor issue. Overall the laptop has been great so far (after a month or so of use), just like all my older Thinkpads. (On my last one the USB-C port wore out so I couldn't reliably charge it. I'm happy that this laptop can be charged using either of two USB-C ports.)",0

B0D53S2PZG,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 November 2017,the United States,False,"Fantastic!

Not only did Amazon Warehouse Deals pull through in delivering a product that appears to be brand new, it was listed as ""Very Good"" condition with only damages to the box being the issue, but the monitor itself is in flawless working condition. Since it was delivered yesterday I have thrown a number of games at it including: Overwatch, Battlefield 1, Hitman: Season One, Aliens Vs. Predator, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Team Fortress 2, and Dishonored.

What I can say is that the 240hz refresh rate is no joke, if you have the CPU / GPU setup to reach the particular ceiling that this GPU sets then you are in for a treat! I was not hitting 240 FPS in Overwatch, but my i7-7700k, EVGA 1080Ti FTW3, and 16GB of DDR4 ram was getting up to about 220 and fluctuating down to about 170 while I was playing. The smoothness of the gameplay is the major selling point here, and coming from a 144hz monitor there is a noticeable change when going to 240hz; not major, mind you, more so a quality of life improvement that just makes aiming a little more precise / smooth.

Having watched a number of youtube reviewers of this monitor espouse that it is not really a necessary purchase, but more so a tool for pro gaming and people who are possibly too serious about their online FPS games holds some salt in my time with the monitor so far. The colors are great, definitely washed out a little with the brightness / gamma settings that come pre-set with the monitor, and the overall clarify is what you would expect for a Full HD 1080p monitor that is 24.5"". Comparatively speaking, having used Dell's 27"" 1440p / 1ms / Gsync monitor prior to this makes it somewhat hard to make the leap back to 1080p, but given the screen real estate you're given to operate with on the PG258Q it is not a major setback.

My real reason for getting this monitor was to enjoy the performance boost of gaming at 1080p and not having to contend with the faster depreciation of my hardware as a result of sticking with either 2K or 4K visuals. My humble opinion, I still think we are a little ways off from having super smooth gaming experiences at those resolutions without having to dial back certain graphical settings to get there. That was something I found myself having to do more often than not, even with a 1080Ti at 1440p, and that was not sitting well with me given how long it has been since I've owned a gaming PC. This time around I wanted to make sure that I could game at very high to ultra settings and this ASUS monitor can make that happen easily!

In closing, 240Hz / 240 FPS for most games is not a realistic or achievable goal with this monitor. You would most likely have to be running an SLI setup of some kind using multiple state of the art GPUs to make that happen. That said, when playing at 1080p and using a modern Intel processor coupled with a GTX 1080Ti, you can make magic happen with this monitor - even if you're not hitting that high FPS ceiling cap. Due to the high cost of this monitor I would recommend taking a gamble on an Amazon Warehouse Deal and try to secure one that is listed as ""Very Good"".

B0D53S2PZG,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,9 January 2015,the United States,False,"Edit: Idk why Amazon turned the pics sideways. They're fine on my computer. Sorry. Anyways, they are there to show backlight bleed at factory settings which was bad, then with the brightness at 44, which is about normal, and it's gone.

Got my monitor yesterday, was worried it would arrive with problems. Soon as I turned it on, I checked it on the black screen for dead pixels and found none! Then checked for stuck pixels and found none! I was then very satisfied with the build quality. Checked out the backlight bleed and it was pretty bad at factory settings at the bottom of the monitor. After I put in some calibration settings, and dropped the brightness from 80 to 44 (it's a very bright monitor) the backlight bleed was non-existent and uniform. The stand came all assembled together, I just took it out, stood it up and plugged it in. Will be mounting to an ergotron arm, but if I didn't have it, I would leave the stand. It looks really nice! G-sync only works in fullscreen mode, which kind of bummed me out when I found that out, but doesn't really matter, because once you experience G-sync, it's unlike anything you've ever seen in gaming. There's no screen tearing, even on small objects like boxes. It looks like I'm playing a screenshot.

You'll need some hardware to really take advantage of this monitor though. At least a 770. Gsync will make 40fps feel like 60fps, it's so smooth. I have an i7 4790k, dual GTX-980s, 8GB of RAM.

Next to my 1440p Viewsonic VP-2770 IPS, it holds up well, but lacks the blacks of the IPS. If there was a gamma feature on this monitor, I'm sure I could dial it in even further. One review I read, had this monitor beating an Overload Korean IPS monitor in tests! I believe it was an e-IPS. My Viewsonic is an S-IPS I think. It's high quality.

Even though they just announced the ASUS ROG SWIFT 4K IPS 60HZ version will be released later this year, with a window of July-September, I still opted for this one. I will probably also get the 4K version, because I have the graphics power to drive it and the build quality is just fantastic.

Pros:
+1440p
+Build Quality is superb. Has to be seen in person to understand.
+Red ring on base of stand that can be turned on and off.
+Easy to navigate On Screen Display.
+Ultra Low Motion Blur
+Gsync does everything that Vsync does BETTER, without input lag. It's just glorious, if you've always hated Vsync (even if you like it, it still does Vsync's job but BETTER) but had to deal with screen tearing. That whole problem is now eliminated.
+1ms response time. In comparison to IPS, which at best is usually 5-6ms (new 4K IPS 60hz Swift to debut this year will be 5-6ms.) Response Time affects the amount of blur the monitor produces from changing colors.
+Super thin bezel makes this thing look as premium as it's price tag.

Neutral points: 8-bit color TN panel. Could be argued either way. It lacks the depth of IPS, but holds it's own well against it. Viewing angles are not a problem for me, even at this screen size. It's not your average TN panel. Can also be argued TN is better for fast paced action games, because it has faster response time and thus, less motion blur on the image.

Cons:
-Availability. When I build my PC back in September, this monitor was scarce and there was a lot of paranoia surrounding it. I just now got my order in, when they became available. Seems the newer batches are fine and getting way better user reviews.
-Can be argued it's not an IPS, but that's ok with me. It's way better than your average TN. Don't listen to people that don't own the monitor. They are just talking nonsense.
-Gsync doesn't work in windowed borderless mode YET! I believe they are working on solving this problem.
-Only ONE input and that's Display Port. So if you plan on using this monitor for something like a video game console on the side, forget it! I still have my Viewsonic, and hopefully the NEW Swift to release this year has multiple inputs.
-Price is steep, but for what is in this package, it's not that bad. People crying about the TN panel just don't understand. It's TN but it's 8bit color. You're paying for the resolution, build quality, size, and gsync (most of all. I believe this little module runs $200 itself. They are working on getting that price down, but it's in such a high demand, it's hard to.)

Conclusion: Terrific monitor. I was scared ordering one, but I don't believe I can go back. This is THE definitive gaming monitor on the market at the time of the review. There are some monitors coming from competitors, like Acer, with 144hz IPS gsync, but it's not really an IPS panel. It's an AHVA panel. Do your homework on these monitors! I STILL am totally satisfied with this monitor based on it's build quality ALONE. I was on the fence about the 4k IPS they have coming this year, but I'll definitely be getting one, maybe a few months after release like I did with this monitor.

ASUS is a big company, with a lot of business, in comparison to other companies. They thus are going to have more negative reviews because they are moving more product. I've heard bad stories about their customer service, so if I were you, I would try to purchase the amazon warranty with this monitor.

B0D53DK5VK,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 November 2017,the United States,False,"Fantastic!

Not only did Amazon Warehouse Deals pull through in delivering a product that appears to be brand new, it was listed as ""Very Good"" condition with only damages to the box being the issue, but the monitor itself is in flawless working condition. Since it was delivered yesterday I have thrown a number of games at it including: Overwatch, Battlefield 1, Hitman: Season One, Aliens Vs. Predator, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Team Fortress 2, and Dishonored.

What I can say is that the 240hz refresh rate is no joke, if you have the CPU / GPU setup to reach the particular ceiling that this GPU sets then you are in for a treat! I was not hitting 240 FPS in Overwatch, but my i7-7700k, EVGA 1080Ti FTW3, and 16GB of DDR4 ram was getting up to about 220 and fluctuating down to about 170 while I was playing. The smoothness of the gameplay is the major selling point here, and coming from a 144hz monitor there is a noticeable change when going to 240hz; not major, mind you, more so a quality of life improvement that just makes aiming a little more precise / smooth.

Having watched a number of youtube reviewers of this monitor espouse that it is not really a necessary purchase, but more so a tool for pro gaming and people who are possibly too serious about their online FPS games holds some salt in my time with the monitor so far. The colors are great, definitely washed out a little with the brightness / gamma settings that come pre-set with the monitor, and the overall clarify is what you would expect for a Full HD 1080p monitor that is 24.5"". Comparatively speaking, having used Dell's 27"" 1440p / 1ms / Gsync monitor prior to this makes it somewhat hard to make the leap back to 1080p, but given the screen real estate you're given to operate with on the PG258Q it is not a major setback.

My real reason for getting this monitor was to enjoy the performance boost of gaming at 1080p and not having to contend with the faster depreciation of my hardware as a result of sticking with either 2K or 4K visuals. My humble opinion, I still think we are a little ways off from having super smooth gaming experiences at those resolutions without having to dial back certain graphical settings to get there. That was something I found myself having to do more often than not, even with a 1080Ti at 1440p, and that was not sitting well with me given how long it has been since I've owned a gaming PC. This time around I wanted to make sure that I could game at very high to ultra settings and this ASUS monitor can make that happen easily!

In closing, 240Hz / 240 FPS for most games is not a realistic or achievable goal with this monitor. You would most likely have to be running an SLI setup of some kind using multiple state of the art GPUs to make that happen. That said, when playing at 1080p and using a modern Intel processor coupled with a GTX 1080Ti, you can make magic happen with this monitor - even if you're not hitting that high FPS ceiling cap. Due to the high cost of this monitor I would recommend taking a gamble on an Amazon Warehouse Deal and try to secure one that is listed as ""Very Good"".

B0D53DK5VK,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,9 January 2015,the United States,False,"Edit: Idk why Amazon turned the pics sideways. They're fine on my computer. Sorry. Anyways, they are there to show backlight bleed at factory settings which was bad, then with the brightness at 44, which is about normal, and it's gone.

Got my monitor yesterday, was worried it would arrive with problems. Soon as I turned it on, I checked it on the black screen for dead pixels and found none! Then checked for stuck pixels and found none! I was then very satisfied with the build quality. Checked out the backlight bleed and it was pretty bad at factory settings at the bottom of the monitor. After I put in some calibration settings, and dropped the brightness from 80 to 44 (it's a very bright monitor) the backlight bleed was non-existent and uniform. The stand came all assembled together, I just took it out, stood it up and plugged it in. Will be mounting to an ergotron arm, but if I didn't have it, I would leave the stand. It looks really nice! G-sync only works in fullscreen mode, which kind of bummed me out when I found that out, but doesn't really matter, because once you experience G-sync, it's unlike anything you've ever seen in gaming. There's no screen tearing, even on small objects like boxes. It looks like I'm playing a screenshot.

You'll need some hardware to really take advantage of this monitor though. At least a 770. Gsync will make 40fps feel like 60fps, it's so smooth. I have an i7 4790k, dual GTX-980s, 8GB of RAM.

Next to my 1440p Viewsonic VP-2770 IPS, it holds up well, but lacks the blacks of the IPS. If there was a gamma feature on this monitor, I'm sure I could dial it in even further. One review I read, had this monitor beating an Overload Korean IPS monitor in tests! I believe it was an e-IPS. My Viewsonic is an S-IPS I think. It's high quality.

Even though they just announced the ASUS ROG SWIFT 4K IPS 60HZ version will be released later this year, with a window of July-September, I still opted for this one. I will probably also get the 4K version, because I have the graphics power to drive it and the build quality is just fantastic.

Pros:
+1440p
+Build Quality is superb. Has to be seen in person to understand.
+Red ring on base of stand that can be turned on and off.
+Easy to navigate On Screen Display.
+Ultra Low Motion Blur
+Gsync does everything that Vsync does BETTER, without input lag. It's just glorious, if you've always hated Vsync (even if you like it, it still does Vsync's job but BETTER) but had to deal with screen tearing. That whole problem is now eliminated.
+1ms response time. In comparison to IPS, which at best is usually 5-6ms (new 4K IPS 60hz Swift to debut this year will be 5-6ms.) Response Time affects the amount of blur the monitor produces from changing colors.
+Super thin bezel makes this thing look as premium as it's price tag.

Neutral points: 8-bit color TN panel. Could be argued either way. It lacks the depth of IPS, but holds it's own well against it. Viewing angles are not a problem for me, even at this screen size. It's not your average TN panel. Can also be argued TN is better for fast paced action games, because it has faster response time and thus, less motion blur on the image.

Cons:
-Availability. When I build my PC back in September, this monitor was scarce and there was a lot of paranoia surrounding it. I just now got my order in, when they became available. Seems the newer batches are fine and getting way better user reviews.
-Can be argued it's not an IPS, but that's ok with me. It's way better than your average TN. Don't listen to people that don't own the monitor. They are just talking nonsense.
-Gsync doesn't work in windowed borderless mode YET! I believe they are working on solving this problem.
-Only ONE input and that's Display Port. So if you plan on using this monitor for something like a video game console on the side, forget it! I still have my Viewsonic, and hopefully the NEW Swift to release this year has multiple inputs.
-Price is steep, but for what is in this package, it's not that bad. People crying about the TN panel just don't understand. It's TN but it's 8bit color. You're paying for the resolution, build quality, size, and gsync (most of all. I believe this little module runs $200 itself. They are working on getting that price down, but it's in such a high demand, it's hard to.)

Conclusion: Terrific monitor. I was scared ordering one, but I don't believe I can go back. This is THE definitive gaming monitor on the market at the time of the review. There are some monitors coming from competitors, like Acer, with 144hz IPS gsync, but it's not really an IPS panel. It's an AHVA panel. Do your homework on these monitors! I STILL am totally satisfied with this monitor based on it's build quality ALONE. I was on the fence about the 4k IPS they have coming this year, but I'll definitely be getting one, maybe a few months after release like I did with this monitor.

ASUS is a big company, with a lot of business, in comparison to other companies. They thus are going to have more negative reviews because they are moving more product. I've heard bad stories about their customer service, so if I were you, I would try to purchase the amazon warranty with this monitor.

Included paper docs show recent testing completed on this device, and a User Manual. All the features of a high-end laptop at a discount price. I am thrilled (so far)! NumPad? Backlit keyboard? All true, all beautiful! ONLY NEGATIVE: one of the pictures in the Amazon ad says ""Extra Large TouchScreen"", but means to say ""Extra Large TouchPad"". This is NOT A TOUCHSCREEN. I'm not mad, the TouchPad is extra large and awesome! (I'm just mildly disappointed with the ""touchscreen"" thing.)",0
B0D3VDPX3M,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,30 January 2025,the United States,False,"I bought this for work back in July. It seemed to fit the bill and I had no issue, although the camera isn't great. I liked the price and the one year warranty, so I was comfortable buying this unknown brand.

Then around October/November, the battery was not lasting very long at all, which I could deal with as long as I had access to an outlet. When I take this with me, it's in my bag. Or I'm working on a lap desk on the couch. Nothing crazy. But I realized that some of the screws came loose on the bottom and the pieces started separating, making it impossible to close. I first contacted the seller on Nov 24th about this. After going back and forth over the last few weeks, I decided to send it back and they agreed to replace it under warranty. (They originally offered to send me some replacement screws and somehow walk me through putting everything back in order, but I have zero confidence or experience in doing such a thing, so I opted for the replacement in light of the battery issue.)

They acknowledge that they received the tracking info, and USPS shows it as delivered as of January 10th. I still have received NO WORD from the seller (it's now the 30th), despite sending a few follow up emails asking on the status of my replacement. I even chatted with Amazon and they asked me to give it up to 14 days, and it's now been 14 business days.

I'm very frustrated and annoyed. It sucks to be out a few hundred dollars and I miss the convenience of being able to work away from home. I did not want to resort to a 1-star review but I really hope the seller will make good on their word.

Of course, it could be that my previous laptop was so old, it had an abacus on the keyboard. Super lightweight, high-res camera and great keyboard feel make this bugger a dream! It even charges fast and I easily get 12 hours of constant use. Doesn't get super-hot, either, but still not a great idea to put any laptop on your actual lap...well, unless you think toasted gonads isn't a problem.
UPDATE: Hmmm...in less than 10 weeks, I have had to return it TWICE to the manufacturer to repair the same issue (the OS won't boot). So, actually, I have only had it in my possession for 6 of the 10 weeks. So very NOT impressed with the build quality. Customer service? Meh, it works after a fashion. PURCHASE ONLY IF YOU DON'T NEED TO USE IT AS YOUR ONLY DEVICE.

UPDATE2: Just sent it back for the THIRD time in 5 months of ownership. Battery issues. REALLY, REALLY, REALLY not happy with this device or with ASUS. DO NOT PURCHASE!",0

B0D24TG3VN,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,4 May 2025,the United States,False,"Wow, I skimmed the reviews on this and wish I hadn't. First off, when I ordered this, there was ""ONLY ONE LEFT"" and it was listed as new. The computer showed up a day early, and it was only in a box with a cord tossed on top. Very obviously used. I go check the listing, and now there are 13 in stock, and all are used. Obvious bait and switch - and you can see it happened to a few other 1 star reviews.

On top of that, this is the slowest computer I've used in years. It constantly has CPU running at 100%, with CPU temp rarely dipping under 150 degrees F. It took 5 hours to install the updates - not because of the quantity or size of the updates, but because of how slow the system speed is.

As I write this, the curser will disappear and the screen will lock up, and eventually all the words will populate. Switching tabs between Chrome and another tab takes 1-5 seconds. Switching to Discord takes roughly 10 seconds. This isnt openning the program, this is switching to an already open tab!

With just Chrome open (with under 10 tabs), system memory is 85% full. I cannot imagine using this for anything other than the most basic of tasks - and only one task at a time, at that!

I am going to wait another couple days before I send this back. In the past, Amazon sends an email or splash screen telling you that you have 90 days to send it back, since it was a refurb - problem is I DIDNT BUY THE REFURB and Amazon doesnt recognize it as a refurb.

B0CZRG6ZRR,Sophie,4.0,"Touchscreen laptop , solid performance with minor flaws",7 June 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"This laptop features a sleek, high-end design with its full metal body and silver-gray tone, making it stand out as a fashion-forward choice. Its slim profile is notably thinner than my previous Lenovo notebook, almost half the thickness. With a 13.5-inch screen and narrow bezels, it boasts a compact overall size that's incredibly convenient to carry around. The keyboard, equipped with three membrane covers and backlit keys, ensures easy typing even in low-light conditions. （as shown in the video)

With a RAM installed size of 16 GB, the actual RAM capacity is 237 GB, slightly lower than the advertised 256 GB. Additionally, there seems to be a discrepancy between the RAM capacity stated in the product description and the one shown in the product images, where it's mentioned as 512 GB. (as shown in the picture) This inconsistency could potentially mislead buyers.

The laptop features four small anti-slip pads on the bottom, with the exhaust fan located primarily in the middle. Its touch screen is highly responsive, allowing for smooth and seamless operation, complemented by the convenient fingerprint recognition for easy unlocking. Overall, it delivers an excellent user experience, with a natural color display and smooth performance, all at a reasonable price of £299.99.

However, it's worth noting that the initial setup process can be somewhat cumbersome, and there's a notable issue with the power plug not fully inserted, leaving a portion exposed, which could pose some safety concerns.

B0CZRG6ZRR,The Tech Guy,5.0,Low-cost touch-screen laptop with reasonable performance.,20 May 2024,the United Kingdom,False,"Sub £300 laptops are always going to compromise on performance and quality, particularly when they ship with a touch-screen.

This offering from Morostron is likely to be one of the better value touch-screen offerings out there.

1st Impressions:

The all-metal body is attractive, albeit a little heavy at 1.345kg. The touch-screen will largely be responsible for that as it adds at least 200g to a laptop's weight.

The screen is fantastic, crystal clear and unusually for a touch-screen display, allows quite wide viewing angles without distortion. The responsiveness of the touch-screen is also surprisingly excellent.

Performance:

Testing with PCMark gave an overall score of 2898 score which is at the budget end of the market, but it's good for this hardware. Individual scores of 6276 for Essentials and 4272 for Productivity show that this is a good laptop for basic PC usage, Web-Browing etc, and light productivity: Word, Excel etc. The lack of a decent graphics card means it will struggle with Photo/Video editing and Games.

SSD speeds of over 4k MBps for both sequential read and write are very good for an M.2 Gen 3 drive.

Upgradeable?:

The back removes easily to reveal some very neat internals. The 256Gb SSD can easily be swapped out for one up to 1Gb in size. Battery replacement if required looks straightforward too. The RAM is easy to remove, but 16Gb may be the max the MOBO supports.

General Use:

The keyboard layout is US unfortunately - perhaps the only minor gripe here, but it's nice to type on with a good tactile action. The trackpad is responsive, although I don't use it, preferring a mouse. The power on button is positioned at the top right of the keyboard. A long press turns it on, a short-press locks the computer and a long-press turns it off.

Two USB-A ports and a USB-C port allow peripherals to be attached. Great job on the USB-C incidentally - many docking stations and hubs are now preferring to use this interface rather than USB-A, yet typically you only find the USB-C port on high end laptops.

The speakers are weak, but as most people will probably use BT headphones or external speaker anyway I'm quite happy for them to cut costs here and the soundcard seems decent enough.

Watching movies in 4k - no problem - they look fantastic on this high-res screen.

If you're in the market for a touch screen and don't plan on using it for anything too demanding, I would seriously recommend giving this one a try. It has its limitations but you are unlikely to find a more performant touch-screen at this price point.

NB
To enter BIOS, hold down ESC while starting the computer - it took me a while to figure that out!
To activate the backlit keyboard, it's FN + Space

B0CZLPB5PB,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,1 December 2024,the United States,False,"I bought this laptop back in October of 2024 - waited awhile to see how it would go before I left a review.
I'm an Apple guy so I was a little nervous going back to Windows. This laptop is very nice. Windows 11 is very nice also. Windows supplies its office suite as a test drive with limited time before they want you sign up for longer periods of time. I'll probably just buy the 1 time deal for 150.00 and then I'll have what I need. I really don't need the 365 suite.

The screen is very bright and does not disappoint. It's very crisp with excellent detail and colors and is 18"". I have not noticed any backlight bleed whatsoever. I only had 16"" on my MacBook Pro. The screen size was a major reason why I wanted this laptop.

The keyboard is backlit and you can change the color to whatever color you want the back light to be. It mainly sits on my desk. I moved it upstairs the other day for a bit on the battery. Battery life is not Apple battery life. It drains fairly quickly compared to my older MacBook Pro, but I'm not travelling with it much and it sits primarily on my desk. The power supply is rather large for it.

Some people were complaining about the fans being too loud. Well, its a gaming laptop and some fan noise is expected. If I were a gamer the fans would be louder I'm sure, but I'm only using it for daily activities and I can here the fans but I'm not bothered by them as they are fairly quiet. The fans are adjustable via the Predator software they provide with the laptop.

McAffee suite comes with it as a trial. The laptop is quick, grant you I'm not pushing to hard, but I have noticed no waiting when it comes to using it, so the processor speed and memory are fine for me. I do watch movies on it and the 18"" screen is exceptional.

All in all I'm very pleased with it. My only complaint is that at first the trackpad was a bit touchy. There is however an adjustment for this in Windows 11 to adjust the sensitivity. I noticed it's on sale for Black Friday that is a better deal than what I paid for it by probably 100 bucks or so back in October. If you want a big laptop, just buy it - you won't be disappointed.

B0CZLPB5PB,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,11 January 2025,the United States,False,"This machine is big, bulky AND very powerful. If you want raw power, then those systems will be heavy. It's a fair price to pay for the raw power. If you want something super light, they will be much less powerful but will have better battery life. So far, I like everything except the sound. With a body as big as this, Acer should be able to provide decent audio right out of the box. Unfortunately it doesn't even match some high end Phone (apple, pixel, samsung) speaker audio. I bought to reduce clutters on my desk, replacing monitors and old workstation. And it does a fine job in that department due to raw cpu/gpu power. The base storage is decent at 1TB but great thing is that you can add a secondary storage and additional ram with two physical slots. Many companies are forcing onboard RAM which prevents you from upgrading. Other than speaker audio, this laptop is excellent. You can use a headphone or connect to external speakers but for this price, audio should have been better. Again, this is a very minor issue because I didn't have anything else to complain about. Happy otherwise.",0
B0CZLPB5PB,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,14 September 2024,the United States,False,"This laptop works amazing! I have not had issues with overheating in the slightest with the ability to toggle between the different modes. The screen quality is so so clear and glorious, I was shocked when I first loaded up a game that takes a lot of graphics. The colors are so vibrant you would think you were using a high end monitor instead of a laptop screen. I have yet to find a game that lags this beast, so I would say the gaming capability is great! The keyboard feels the same as just about any other laptop keyboard. Even setting this thing up was a breeze!

I highly recommend this over the neo i9 because I feel like the ability to change and upgrade is one of the most important parts of this laptop. There are two M.2 slots, one taken by the main drive which is 1 Terabyte, the other open and free to add another one, which I took my 2 Terabyte one from my previous laptop and put it in it. The ram is accessible and as long as you use DDR5 and get the correct size, you can upgrade it from what I can tell. You can't upgrade the CPU or GPU but honestly I don't feel like you need to. Unless you are on the drop for brand new games as they are coming out, this beast has plenty of gaming power to go around.",0

Speaker is about like most cheaper to mid gaming laptops these days- not great/tinny; I generally use headphones anyway. Fan noise is what you'd expect from a gaming laptop with a 4070 in it. Large brick for battery, generally going to want to keep plugged in if playing any intense games for any length of time.

I upgraded ram to 32 gigs (2 x 16) and added a terabyte m.2. Both were very easy to replace expect you'll need a torque/star drive to get the screws out. You'll want a hard thin piece of plastic to help pry off the back too. Overall it's a really good laptop, I'm using it as my main basically now; I primarily play video games like kingdome come, starship troopers, stardew valley and some total war series lately.

B0CZL2SLCJ,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,25 May 2024,the United States,False,"Windows S Mode and McAfee are glitchy performance killers and restrictive applications. Switching out of Win 11 S mode should be a straight forward process but it just does not work as it should, along with McAfee installed, whether you want it or not. McAfee acts like a worm virus, intrusively imbedding itself deep into system architecture instead of being a gate keeper like other anti-virus apps. Windows S Mode dose not allow you to install and run any app that is not Microsoft verified and found on the Microsoft Store. In S Mode, you cannot install and run any browser other than MS Edge or Bing. There is an app within the MS Store to switch out of S mode but it will not work because, I suspect, of the bloated software that launches when you first turn on and set up this laptop. Switching out of S Mode is permanent. All the advise and direction I found to get this switch to work had failed. Lots of frustrated people out there with the same issue. I finally got MS Support on the phone and they told me this is a very common problem with this product and the only way to resolve it was to reset the PC. A total reset, wiping the OS and all files you may have added. No big deal as this is a new PC and I did not transfer anything from my old PC. After the PC was reset, I was able to switch out of S mode so that I now have Win 11 Home instead of Win 11S Home. At the same time, a McAfee install popup was automatically prompted so I could select Do Not Install. This was all a bit of a pain but other than that, this laptop is not so bad. The display colors are not as vibrant as I hoped but with a resolution of only 1365 x 768, I should have expected that. However, the graphics display very well on a connected higher resolution monitor and it handles steaming video from Amazon Prime Video beautifully. I hope this information can help someone avoid the frustration of dealing with what was intentionally sold as a very restrictive operating environment. Getting rid of S Mode and McAfee gives you back unrestricted use of your laptop.

One more annoying detail is that, by default, this operating environment is set to save everything to the MS cloud. The default storage of Document, Downloads, Pictures, etcetera, are all MS cloud folders which is where every file is stored unless you go through a few more clicks to store the files on your local laptop drive. By default, initially you cannot even boot up this laptop without entering your MS PIN to log onto your laptop, and thereby logging into your MS account at the same time. I found this a bit presumptuous that MS thought this was a good idea. Perhaps good for their own marketing efforts though, as some bot scans your files for things you do in order to tailor marketing ad pushes to you personally, but I digress. If you do not want Big Brother holding on to all your personal, professional, private, or other data, then you need to go in to system settings and turn off the MS log in PIN. Doing so allows you to boot up your laptop to your local drive account only. You can always log in and log out of your MS account if and when you choose at any time. Of course, you can even turn off your own laptop log in password so it just simply turns on. without a password. Your choice, as it should be.

B0CZBS3XK8,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,12 August 2024,Mexico,False,"Compre esta laptop durante prime day por 26k pesos mexicanos, por ese precio es completamente imbatible y nada se le compara, aun con algo mas de precio vale mucho la pena.

Lo mejor:
-El rendimiento, sin ser absolutamente tope de gama en CPU/GPU para el tamaño que tiene es un monstruo, las RTX 4070 normalmente se encuentran en laptops mucho mas grandes y pesadas y tener el mismo rendimiento en formato pequeño es un plus, no creo que sea viable poner componentes mas potentes (y con mucho mas consumo) en un cuerpo tan pequeño, ya es top como esta.

-La versatilidad: esta laptop es muy ligera y pequeña, gracias al tamaño y a la potencia la puedes llevar facilmente en una mochila, pesa poco y cuando este desconectada usar como laptop para productividad o cosas ligeras, conectada para juegos, es todo terreno y tengo entendido que soporta cargadores USB C de unos 90w, aunque no he podido probarlo

-La calidad de construccion: esta laptop es casi completamente aluminio lo cual no es comun en laptop aun mucho mas caras, la calidad de construccion sin llegar a los niveles de macbook esta muy bien, ya podrian aprender otras marcas, que es una verguenza que laptops gamer de mucho mas precio tengan cuerpo mayormente de plastico

-El lector de huella y el teclado: otra cosa que normalmente no hay en laptops gamer (y menos a ese precio) me parece un punto a favor, el teclado sin ser una maravilla es bastante bueno y tiene iluminacion por tecla (no por zona), algo igualmente poco comun en laptops gamer de este precio

-La pantalla: Con miniled, una resolucion muy alta y HDR es una maravilla que ya quisieran laptops mucho mas caras, se ve excelente y llega a niveles casi de un macbook, la mejor pantalla no OLED del mercado, y con G Sync ufff, no podria pedir mas

Lo peor:
Que no se pueda ampliar la RAM: Tal vez sea por el tamaño que no permite slots DDR5 normales, pero la RAM esta soldada Y no es reemplazable, 16gb empiezan a ser normalitos y eso limita mucho la vida util de la laptop de aqui a unos años (y seguramente la descarta completamente patra ciertas tareas que requieran gran cantidad de memoria) una lastima que aqui no se venda la version de 32gb que si haria mucha falta, al menos el SSD SI es reemplazable...

La velocidad del puerto microsd: al principio me emocione al saber que tenia puerto micro sd ya que es facil ampliar la memoria y meter mas juegos y cosas, pero el puerto es bastante lento, me da velocidades de 12mb/s en memorias micro sd buenas de samsung, no me quiero imaginar como seria con memorias mas normales, es un puerto para musica y videos, y aun asi apenas alcanza para eso...

La bateria: sin ser mala esperaba que durara mas por 76w, unas 3 o 4 horas en ofimatica y web dependiendo de los settings que le pongas, una bateria de 80w haria que mejorara algo el tiempo y yo creo que el tamaño/peso seguiria sin ser problema, por supuesto olvidate de jugar algo que no sea 2d en bateria, la laptop no esta hecha para eso (como casi todas las laptop gamer)

El ruido: la laptop hace bastante ruido de ventilador en juegos, y aun en tareas sencillas en el modo rendimiento hace un pequeño siseo que podria resultar molesto, yo me acostumbre pero hay gente que podria encontrarlo muy molesto o insoportable

La salida de video USB C no esta conectada a la GPU: En otras laptops gamer que he tenido con mux switch en modo de solo GPU dedicada puedes conectar un monitor externo y hacer que este monitor este conectado directamente a la GPU para tener mejor rendimiento y activar G Sync/freesync, pues en esta laptop no, usar el modo de solo GPU dedicada DESACTIVA la salida de video por USB C (y te avisa por un mensaje) asi que el G sync solo funciona en la pantalla de laptop , es algo que nunca habia visto en ninguna otra laptop y no se si es por alguna limitacion tecnica, es una decepcion bastante grande para gamers mas hardcore, para el usuario normal no hay tanto problema, tal cual viene se puede conectar a monitores por USB C (o HDMI), pero como usa optimus y el monitor lo controla la dedicada de intel no tendra el maximo rendimiento en juegos (si no entendiste muy bien lo que comente no deberia preocuparte en absoluto)

En resumen es una excelente laptop, tiene caracteristicas muy top que se encuentran en modelos mucho mas caros a precio contenido, yo la compre en oferta pero aun valdria la pena si valiera 32k, aun por ese precio no hay casi nada mejor.

Recomiendo actualizar a la ultima bios de acer desde la pagina web en cuanto la tengan en las manos, las actualizaciones de bios son importantes y especialmente esta ya que mejora el soporte en las ultimas versiones de W11.

Thanks to its advanced lithography-based chip, energy consumption is remarkably low, with minimal performance impact from reduced voltage. Even after gaming, temperatures remain exceptionally low.

The main drawbacks are the limited port selection and soldered RAM. However, as long as you manage your workload efficiently—avoiding excessive multitasking during intensive tasks—performance remains stable. The lack of ports can be mitigated with a USB dock featuring HDMI and RJ45 Ethernet.

You can pretty much game on high - ultra at 1440p and stay above 60 fps, or if you want more fps, you can lower the resolution at 1080p and get even more fps.

Things I don't like:

- Poor battery life: If you tune the settings, you can get at most 2 hours of battery, and if you like to get more performance on the go, you can probably get 1 hour and 20 mins.

- Gets really hot: when gaming, the aluminum under screen and the center of the keyboard can get so hot that sometimes you can not place your hand or fingers for too long.",0

B0CY3D78GL,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,30 March 2025,Germany,False,"Das funktionelle und formschöne Gerät und übertrifft die Kritiken. Rezensionen beschrieben den Lap häufig als Preisknüller mit einer Einschränkung beim Farbraum. Man erhält wirklich viel Leistung für das Geld. Es gibt auch keine Mängel, die die Werbung schön redet und die erst nach dem Kauf auffallen.
Die in Tests oft bemängelte Einschränkung beim Farbraum ist m. E. ohne Messgeräte nicht feststellbar und zum anderen ob der Funktion des Geräts bedeutungslos. Der Lap soll wegen der -guten- Grafikkarte wohl auch zum mobilen Spielen dienen. Gerade hier ist eine völlige Farbtreuheit unnötig.
Das Gewicht ist ungewohnt im Vergleich zu Nicht-Gaming Laptops, aber wegen der Grafikkarte unvermeidbar und auch nicht störend.
Dafür hat man ein auch für aktuelle Spiele und zum Arbeiten taugliches Gerät, welches zudem noch eine Zehnertastatur aufweist. Ein klarer Pluspunkt gegenüber vielen Mitbewerbern. Die Tastatur ist kurzhubig und hat auch für Vielschreiber einen angenehmen Anschlag.
Der leicht mattierte Bildschirm vermindert Blendungen und Spiegelungen und ist hinreichend lichtstark. Er ist auch groß genug für Arbeit und Spiel. Ansonsten kann man jederzeit einen externen Bildschirm anschließen. Dann entfällt auch für kritische Augen das Problem mit dem Farbraum.
Als fehlend gegenüber meinem vorherigen Lenovo Carbon empfinde ich nur den nicht vorhandenen Fingerabdrucksensor, den man aber als USB-Stecker nachrüsten kann. Er machte die Anmeldung doch deutlich bequemer. Auch die Gesichtserkennung für Windows Hello funktioniert nicht. Beides war aber auch nicht als vorhanden angekündigt.
Die Erstinstallation der Software ging reibungslos und schnell.

Alles in allem ein gelungenes Gerät, das ich wieder kaufen würde.

B0CY3D78GL,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,21 March 2025,Germany,False,"Pro:
- Angebotspreis 970 Euro guter Deal.
- Auch Hardware hungrige Spiele wie Cyberpunk 2077 laufen auf 1080p bei 60+ FPS / Ultra Setting / Raytracing mittel durchgehend flüssig.
- Multiplayer Spiele bei denen 100+ Spieler auf einem Bildschirm aktiv sind packt der Laptop ohne Probleme.
- Ein zweiten Bildschirm über HDMI als 2. Bildschirm, oder als Hauptanzeige nutzen kein Problem.
- Weiteren Arbeitsspeicher und eine zweite SSD kann man relativ einfach einbauen.
- Ein sauberes Windows 11 wurde ohne unnötige Software vorinstalliert.

Contra:
- Wer allgemein einen Gaming Laptop nutzt, sollte das nur tun wenn man dabei ein Headset nutzt, da diese unter voller Last deutlich lauter sind, als ein PC. Nutzt man aber sowieso ein Headset ist das kein Problem.

Ansonsten habe ich mir vor dem Kauf drei Testvideos auf YouTube angeschaut und wurde nicht enttäuscht. Wer aktuelle Spiele mit der Auflösung von 1080p spielen will, dabei ein Headset nutzt, hat hier ein kleines praktisches und leistungsstarkes Gerät.

I wanted this to read digital books and scientific papers and little else. It has a very nice, sharp screen, so it works for my purpose. It also can be positioned several ways, due to the 180 degree hinge. I found that turning it to the tablet configuration was not a good solution, but other ways work well.

I had this Chromebook for about 10 months when the onscreen keyboard started to randomly activate itself. At first I was able to clear it by restarting my Chromebook. Mind you, it was NOT turned on in my settings. When I contacted customer service through their website, which was a very confusing experience, they offered to have it shipped to them for service. The nearest service facility was hours from my location. I did a power wash, you all know what a pain that is, and sent the machine back. Within a week a received it back and the onscreen keyboard began activating itself again. Customer service again had me send it in for service and I quickly received it back. The problem had not been resolved. So, I thought maybe if I disabled the touchscreen capability, the onscreen keyboard would also be disabled. NOT SO! It continues to randomly turn itself on and off. Even restarting my Chromebook does not fix it. Customer service has been useless. The only solution they offer is to keep sending it back to them, where they again turn it on and the keyboard doesn’t pop up, they close the case, call it fixed and return it to me again.

B0CXG3DBQV,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,24 September 2024,the United States,False,"In terms of performance, it's great with Intel Ultra 7. Thunderbolt port allows easy expansion, fast data transfer.

For ordinary folks, who might need more space, buy the 1TB model or be happy with the 512gb version.

For geeks or those thinking of buying it and THEN upgrading storage, DIYers - it takes a bit of effort and time to replace SSD. You have to remove a bunch of screws, heat-sink and then replace the 2230 sized SSD. Wait, that's not all. IF you're doing a clean installation of Windows, you have to disable the super annoying Intel VMD/RST controller. You will need to use some USB-C hub, connect other USB mouse + keyboard and press this combo: Entering BIOS (press F2 key while booting), go to ""Advanced "" tab, enter the secret menu by pressing CTRL (right) + Shift (right) + Alt (left) + F2. Then go to System Agent Configuration > VMD > Configuration VMD and disable the controller. Now if you go back to Windows installation, it will recognize the new SSD. If you choose to CLONE the original drive that came with it, then you don't have to worry about this bios stuffs. Just use any tool to clone the original. A bit disappointed why MSI made SSD upgrade a little difficult but again, unlike Apple, yes we can!",0

+Display quality is excellent for a 7"" IPS panel

-155H may be too powerful. The handheld struggles running below 30W. Windows 11 24H2 parks 2 P-cores and 4 E-cores automatically when power constrained which does help.
-Alchemist LPE iGPU can be poorly optimized for some games
-16GB memory limits multi-tasking ability
-SSD upgrade requires removal of battery and CPU heatsink

Overall this thing loves to run docked at 40W TDP being used as a miniPC. It is good value if that's your primary use case.

B0CWG8218C,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,22 December 2022,the United States,False,"I bought this Chromebook to replace my old one. The battery just died on my old Acer and it’s just seems to be more expensive and problematic to replace a simple battery than what it is worth.

I am a lawyer and I need this to be used for work whilst in trial. The benefit of 2020 was the forced much needed upgrade to the electronic capabilities of the court system. So, now we have had learned to basically run a trial on our computers. I can make changes on agreements, motions, etc live and grab exhibits from the court website.

The laptop is 360 convertible and can be used as a tablet. I have used this tablet to present to a witness instead of a 300 page series of bank statements.

It is touchscreen which makes this very useful. I can draft motions and sign them right in the screen (I have a stylus pen).

In the last 2 months I have spent a total of 5 weeks in PR and I did. It bring my laptop. I brought this instead. If you are used to the cloud (I use google drive), a cloud based management software and have a good back office, then I this is all you may need. FedEx and a printing service are 3 miles from me.

It is 11.6 inches, which for me is the perfect size for travel or for a laptop on the go. I travel is a portable 15 inch monitor. It’s super thin. With that, and a mouse, I have a mobile office.

I really like this Chromebook. I don’t miss my laptop back at the office right now (I am back in PR).

The drawbacks I find is that it doesn’t have great processing power. The Chromebook becomes unresponsive at times (both keyboard and screen). It just freezes at the worst time. I wish it had one more usb or at least an hdmi. I also wish Chromebook s had page down, page up and home buttons but apparently that is too much to ask.

I am pretty happy with this Chromebook. It is not perfect and the processing power is on the low end but it is perfect for what I need. Not a graphics workhorse.

B0CWB3QTGF,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,30 August 2024,the United States,False,"I'm experiencing a learning curve from handing in my old Dell laptop (retirement) to getting used to this new machine. Some things are great - no more long wait times for the laptop to boot up, for example. I also like the customization of the dock (although my laptop also was nicely customized), showing me the most often used apps I need access to. However, I HATE not having lit keys on the keyboard. This one is totally on me, as I thought that I had narrowed my wish list down to devices with a lit keyboard.

Since the Lenovo has limited storage (though mine does have 64GB of local storage), I purged my old files from my Dell onto a portable hard drive and moved my important daily-need files into two clouds: pCloud (2 TB) and a personal free OneDrive cloud. The latter is extremely helpful if you wish to edit your existent Windows docs and Excel sheets as you will still be able to do that in the cloud. If you open these MS files inside a Chromebook, they will either be non-editable or be converted to Google docs and sheets (as per your setting). The file explorer can be linked directly to your clouds (most of the common ones, at least), so that you can download items onto the Lenovo, then pull them over into the cloud storage folders you specify. That's a really helpful feature.

Transitioning from Windows Outlook onto Google calendar was hard. :( The Lenovo allows the Google Calendar icon to appear on the dock, which is very helpful; nevertheless you might have a hard time getting used to the new ""universe"" if you're not Google-familiar.

I played around with this machine while it wasn't plugged in and it lasted forever. That is really nice. Plus it doesn't run HOT like my old Dell did!

I like the built-in calculator, which makes this a larger device, not something that is easily toted around. I miss the ability to lock the calculator to prevent accidental inputs. The Lenovo's calculator is just a web app that you can pin to the dock. The actual calculations seem to be running online rather than on your device (hence no lock).

The sound is accessed by clicking on the time icon on the lower right. It took me a while to figure out as the two sound icons on top of the keyboard didn't seem to be functional. I initially took off a point for the lack of sound control via keyboard. But in the meantime, I found the manual for this machine and learned that the launcher icon (the white circle between the ""tab"" and the ""shift"" keys) must be pressed for any of the function keys to work. The launcher by itself shows you the available apps, files, and images. It will also show you a page with the keyboard short cuts.

If you like quick access to Google apps (Maps, YouTube, Photos, Keep) and other apps (Netflix, Prime Video, your password manager), you can pin them directly to the dock and they will either open in full-screen mode or within your browser. You can pin quite a few. I have 12 apps pinned right now, but there is room for more.

You can also pin your favorite files to the right of the dock for quick access. In addition, if you have an android phone, messages will flash quickly on the right part of the dock. This is great for two-factor authentication, as you don't even need your phone nearby.

So all around, there is stuff to learn if you're new to a Chromebook, but this Lenovo has you covered.

B0CWB3QTGF,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,24 December 2024,the United States,False,"Purchased this Chromebook because my husband has mobility issues making it hard for him to climb stairs to use the PC upstairs. It was pretty easy to set up and connect with the Wi Fi. We purchased the extended warranty from Asurion. The extended warranty offers a team that can be called for tech support for set up and any issues or questions. That was very helpful for learning since I had never had a laptop for Chromebook before. The person I spoke with was very easy to understand and completely helpful. Initially, I could not connect with my Dell printer (Wi fi) upstairs. Tech support had me do an update and easily helped me with settings to use to search for the printer. They did tell me that the Chromebook may not work with older printers. My printer is a bit older but has been doing fine.

For some reason the Wi Fi signal is frequently weak, but I have not taken the time to question tech support about this and I admit we do not have the best internet service in the small town we live in. The only thing that seems to affect it is logging onto my AT&T Yahoo email account. The Chromebook is Google and the Gmail account logs on without any issues in the direct link.

Overall, I have been completely satisfied with this Chromebook and would recommend it. We use it to search the internet, read email, order things (Amazon, pizza, etc) and it works well for our needs.

B0CWB3QTGF,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,6 January 2025,the United States,False,"I have an issue with the cursor moving all over the page when emailing or writing in Documents. Amazon gave me the number of Lenovo. I called their Tech Support, and 2 of 3 calls were dropped. On my third call, I asked to speak with someone without a heavy accent...when the tech returned to the call, I could barely hear him, but he said they would call me back. I am unsure if they will return my call, and I feel abandoned by this company.
However, whether or not they return my call and help me resolve the issue, I do not recommend this company! I spent close to two hours during my first two calls going back and forth trying this and that to no satisfaction or resolution (of the problem).
While I am sure the Techs are trying their best, each had such heavy accents that I had to ask them to repeat almost everything they said.
I regret purchasing this laptop, which I now think is an expensive piece of trash! I am retired on a limited income, and wasting so much money is not good for me.

B0CVZ1297J,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,3 October 2024,the United States,False,"I’ve been using the ASUS Vivobook 16-inch, and it’s a solid performer. The FHD+ display (1920 x 1200) provides great screen space, perfect for multitasking. The design is sleek in black, and despite the larger screen, it’s still quite portable.

With the Intel Core i7-1255U and 40GB of RAM, it handles everything I throw at it, from multiple apps to heavier tasks. The 1TB SSD ensures fast load times and plenty of storage. I love the HDMI port for easy external display connection, and the Wi-Fi is strong and reliable.

It comes with Windows 11, which runs smoothly, and while the webcam isn’t the best, it works well enough for video calls. Battery life is decent, but for power-heavy tasks, it drains quicker.

B0CV61D899,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,2 March 2025,the United States,False,This laptop is a backup for my business laptop and will only use for business - stay connected to WiFi all day- no issues - is it slower than some— it’s under $200 so of course it is. Do I plan to use it with an HdMi to micro HDMI - yep! So no issues with adding a monitor. Do I use a external keyboard and mouse/ sure do. So no issues with the mousepad. Do I have a power station so I can add more monitors or other peripheral devices- of course so do. To the people who say it’s slow and it only has 4 ports and one is a micro/ or it has less ram than they need. It’s under $200 and mine is purple …additionally to the WiFi complaints I had that issue and when I upgraded my WiFi to the highest 1000 + / or whatever is the highest for your area— I stopped having dis connectivity issues with my last laptop. You also may need a new modem- the old ones worked with like 10 devices - so this new laptop may be putting you over the limit. Update your device and it will work. So it is wonderful for me. Did I mention is was under $200?,0
B0CV61D899,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,15 February 2025,the United States,False,"Works fine enough (when it works).

There are some serious connectivity issues when it comes to this device and wifi. Without fail, after every 30 or so minutes, it disconnects from wifi and claims no wifi is available. The only way to rectify it is to restart the computer (which takes 5+ minutes, start to finish).

Every other device in my household AND my internet router (and provider) disagree....the wifi exists and there is no reason for the disparity beyond an issue with the device itself.

Other than that, the slow and laggy processing speed, the over-reactive mousepad (had to turn it off and only use a wireless mouse), off-sized USB ports (good luck getting anything in or out of those), lack of a standard HDMI or USB C (only has a micro) port, and questionable battery life....it is fine enough.

I purchased it primarily for writing, so it serves it's purpose in that respect. If I was using it for literally anything else......this review would likely be far harsher.

Update: one day after writing my initial review, Chrome, Firefox, and Edge ceased working entirely. No fixes offered by the Windows troubleshooting program, no indication of what is wrong.....my internet is working perfectly.

Without connectivity, this device is now absolutely useless to me.

B0CV3CDRNG,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,27 December 2024,the United States,False,"This laptop is cheaply priced, why is that? Because of its 4 GB of RAM. RAM is essentially the short term memory of the computer, it allows you to switch quickly (or not) across the different task you’re doing on the computer. I use my laptop for mostly personal and a little work use which looks like checking email, browsing the internet, the occasionally zoom meeting. 4G RAM meant really slow loading time from starting up the computer to trying to open an app or new internet tab. I had to log out of a zoom training because the audio was too static-y due to “system demands” (I had 5 tabs open). A quick internet search would tell you that you want to go with a minimum of 8-16 GB of RAM (I ended up opting for a $250 refurbished laptop with 16 GB and have no issue with loading time). Another beware before considering buying: I ended up returning this product and I was aware they’d charge me a $7 return shipping fee, when my refund finally processed they also charged me a $56 restocking fee. Not worth the buy at all. I see many saying this is a good choice for a student… as a former college student and as the aunt of gen z and gen alpha kids, I can only imagine this being frustrating and not actually helpful to the multiple task you’d want your computer to be able to do for personal and school use.",0

B0CV14YNH5,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,30 April 2025,Germany,False,"Das Notebook wird sehr heiß.

Die Lautsprecher geben nicht den Sound her, wie es in der Produktbeschreibung behauptet wird. Es klingt recht blechern. Das ändert sich auch nicht, wenn die DTS-Equalizer Einstellungen optimal eingestellt werden. Da gab es mal von HP, Acer und DELL Notebooks mit wesentlich besserem Klang.

Dieses Notebook ist so konzipiert, daß ein Austausch der NVMe-SSD oder der Speichermodule für unbedarfte Benutzer nicht möglich ist. Erstaunlicherweise gibt es keinen zweiten NVMe-Steckplatz. Es gibt zwar zwei Videos darüber im Internet, die aber die Gefahren nicht ganz offenlegen. Die Steckplätze befinden sich unterhalb der Tastatur, die nicht abgehoben werden kann. Dafür muß also das Mainboard, welches mit dünner Wärmeleitfolie verklebt ist, im Gehäuse gewendet werden. Schrauben finden und lösen reicht nicht. Es müssen noch einige mehradrige Flachkabel mit empfindlichen Steckverbindungen, die auch mit starken Klebebändern versehen sind, gelöst werden. Und genau deshalb sollte man die Finger davon lassen. Das Mainboard liegt auch nicht locker passend auf den Schraubgewinden, sondern sehr eng und stramm, so daß man es beim Rückbau nicht wieder so positioniert bekommt, wie es war.

Fazit:
Für diesen hohen Preis erwarte ich nicht nur ein schönes Design, sondern auch eine vernünftige Qualität in der Audioausgabe, einen durchdachten einfachen Zugang zu den austauschbaren Speichermedien und einen zweiten NVMe-Steckplatz. Wer nicht beabsichtigt oder durch Defekt gezwungen wird, SSD oder Speichermodule zu tauschen, kann dieses Notebook in guter Gehäusequalität nutzen. Er oder sie hat sich dann nur noch mit der starken Hitzeausstrahlung und der relativ schlechten Audioqualität abzufinden. Die Beschreibung zur Soundqualität und die Modellbezeichnung „Studio“ sind hier leider nicht zutreffend.

I'll switch to another YT video, for example, and the sound goes out or there is no bass.

The laptop has an average weight.

The camara is not bad, but not good as well just average is not a iPhone doing FaceTime but it will get you through the meetings without a problem, didn’t feel any lagging or any issue in a 3 hours meeting. The material outside is good and sturdy. The keyboard has nice buttons I just wish it was the keyboard with light. But i knew that when i bought it. Overall is good. I did take my toefl test with it and their program sucks and to be honest normally affordable laptops don’t run that well programs to heavy. But guess what!! This one did, it run smoothly no crushes i have even played with it. Let me just make it clear. It is not a gamer laptop resolution of the screen is not bad but when it comes to games the processor can’t handle it that well. For the price it works better than what I expected. So if you are looking for a laptop to work or study that can handle your 8 open windows while running music and not crushing at all let me tell you this is a good choice. Also the intel core it has is the best version of the i3 which is better than the i5
Also the memory ram and the ssd both can be upgraded which means a lot!! For those that wants an smoother from 8.5 to 10 /10 you can upgrade both the ram and ssd it would probably get you to the 9.5 out of 10 😊

I am NOT a Windows expert by any means. Prefer Linux.
When I bought this, I didn't realize the complexity of Win 11 over Win 10 !!
So, after I got this, I leaned that MICROSOFT had implanted something, that if the laptop felt it was being ""intruded"" upon, it locked up and you had to find/get the BitLocker ""key"" to re-open the laptop!!!
After, I created a Microsoft account, I was able to get this very long number to get MY laptop back in MY control!!
Then, when I tried to download an app that I wanted, Microsoft didn't like it, & blocked by saying it wasn't in the Microsoft library!!
I then had to contact a Microsoft tech, whom said that my Window version was Mode ""S"", meaning secure/safe.
He had to take control of my laptop, and download a file, in order to be able to turn Mode ""S"" OFF!!
I prefer a Linux OS over dominating Windows any day, but, unfortunately this is how they come.
Win 10 is a bit more relaxed, but Win 11 is horrible, in my opinion, not at all user friendly, except to a professional Geek.

B0CT3DH9PH,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,18 April 2024,the United States,False,"Quisiera compartir mi experiencia con este producto para ayudar a aquellos que, como yo, se enfrentaron a indecisiones al momento de adquirirlo debido a la escasez de información en español sobre lo que buscaba.

Opté por comprar esta laptop con la intención de utilizarla para tareas de oficina, disfrutar de algunos juegos casuales como Dota 2, y eventualmente editar videos cortos de mi dron DJI mini 3 en Davinci Resolve (aunque aún no he tenido la oportunidad de probarlo).

Antes de realizar esta compra, cabe destacar mi experiencia previa con mi antigua laptop Asus X450CA, equipada con un procesador Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3337U CPU, que ya mostraba signos de fallos.

Tras una exhaustiva investigación de diferentes opciones para encontrar la mejor relación calidad-precio, mis opciones se redujeron a la Asus VivoBook15 F1504ZA (i3 1215u) y la Acer Aspire 3 A315-24P-R7VH (Ryzen 7320U).

Finalmente me decidí por la Asus debido a mi experiencia previa satisfactoria con la marca. Aunque ambas computadoras contaban con solo 128GB de memoria interna SSD, lo cual consideré poco, la Asus ofrecía la posibilidad de expandir tanto la capacidad del SSD como la memoria RAM. Aunque la Acer contaba con memoria DDR5 y la Asus con DDR4, solo esta última permitía la expansión.

A continuación, mencionaré algunos aspectos negativos del producto, que considero justificados dadas las características y el precio económico del equipo: En mi opinión, el principal punto débil de esta laptop es la calidad de la pantalla, que no es muy alta. La duración de la batería es de aproximadamente 4.5 horas con un uso moderado, pero al jugar se reduce a unas 2.5 horas. La tarjeta gráfica es Intel UHD, a diferencia de lo que indican las especificaciones técnicas, que mencionan Intel Iris Xe.

Entre los aspectos positivos, que he podido confirmar en poco tiempo, se encuentran los siguientes: La laptop es muy rápida, el teclado tiene un tacto excelente, la ampliación de la RAM y del SSD es sencilla, el sonido es espléndido, en juegos como Dota 2 alcanza los 80fps o más, tiene un diseño sencillo y elegante, y la mayor parte del tiempo los ventiladores no emiten ruido alguno.

Algunos datos adicionales que pueden resultarte útiles:

Según mi investigación, es posible aumentar la capacidad del SSD a 1TB y la memoria RAM a 16GB.

Basándome en mi experiencia personal, he ampliado el disco duro a 500GB con un SSD Kingston Nvme m.2. PCIe 4.0 (aunque el producto solo soporta PCIe 3.0, acepta la instalación del 4.0, aunque no alcanza su velocidad máxima, solo la permitida por el 3.0). También he aumentado la memoria RAM de 8GB (Memoria RAM soldada) a 16GB con una memoria Kingston SODIMM DDR4 de 3200MHz de 8GB (en el slot libre que ofrece el producto).

Para concluir, un dato que podría ayudar en la decisión de compra de este excelente producto (al menos para mí): En algunos comentarios he visto quejas sobre el equipo que viene con Windows S. Recomiendo no perder tiempo devolviendo el equipo, ya que la gente que puede comentar es solo la que lo ha comprado. En su lugar, buscar un tutorial en Youtube.com sobre cómo cambiar de Windows S a Windows normal, lo cual tomará aproximadamente 30 segundos (ten en cuenta que si se realiza este cambio, no será posible volver a Windows S).

¡Saludos y espero haber sido de ayuda! 😄

This isn't for power users who, for example, run Adobe Creative Suite, but you probably know that.

It's a basic laptop without all the bells and whistles shop.

What really sold me on it was that the memory is upgradeable.

Also, don't mistake a Core i3-1215U for a slouch: it's faster than the Core i5-1135G7 (from the last generation).",0

Boot up at 31 seconds is good (albeit twice as slow as a smaller Gateway with 1/8 the RAM). Battery life is not great – 3.5 hours at moderate use (Netflix), *maybe* to 5 hours for strictly word processing? (N.B. have been truly spoiled by smaller Gateway with 15+ hour battery life! [however, for other reasons, would never purchase another Gateway]). OMSERVB max speaker volume is poor – just as in most current laptops. On the other hand, web page loading & other processing is extremely quick. Having MS Office pre-installed is quite convenient. This is my first no-name laptop. Other laptops, despite some extremely hard international travel in very taxing climates, have lasted 7, 9 and 11 years (all ASUS – and always traveling with 2 laptops) – I’ll be happy, maybe even surprised, if this OMSERVB lasts even a year. Bottom Line: Quite Wary of those chipsets potentially overheating (even with fan working). (I own 6 laptops, all with the same hardware monitoring [HWMonitor]).

B0CRLFVRHK,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,15 March 2025,the United States,False,"Great gameplay, but too many tweaks and manual settings required to use/keep this gaming laptop.

(I got the model w the i9-14900HX and the Nvidia Geforce RTX 4070. 32g RAM.)

So firstly... it does definitely play/display games amazingly. I mainly play World of Warcraft and i have all the settings on high and i put an fps can on at 100, and it holds that 100 STEADY like i've pretty much barely ever seen it drop below that yet. Smooth gameplay and the world looks so good on the 18"" screen. THE PROBLEM..... if you use Asus's manual settings in their ""armoury crate"" app which is the software that lets you control fans and power and all that..... eventually this thing will damage itself. I had it on what's supposed to be a ""balanced"" mode so not too much power usage and no turbos or overclocking on anything, and when it's in that mode it BARELY kicks your fans on! It still was playing great but it let my CPU temp jump up to 87C and it was still climbing but to protect the longevity of this laptop i shut the game and went back to armoury crate. My fix has been throwing it ""Manual Mode"" and setting my own custom fan curves (I set them to come on much stronger much sooner than the base Asus settings would) and this has helped a LOT. Last night i played WoW for like 4 hours and my CPU temp never exceeded 72 which is really good in game under load temp. But again my point is....... If not for my manual setting..... this laptop would beat itself to death.

I'd like to be able to recommend this gaming laptop to other buyers but in my right mind, i can not. Between those awful built in fan/power settings , AND then also the random CPU temp spikes i see while idling (and NO i do NOT have any background apps running lol, anddddd i stopped any unnecessary background tasks/processes as well.) I'll still sometimes see my idle CPU temp randomly jump from 43 (awesome idle temp) up to like 64 (AWFUL idle temp, this is the temp of a pc that's under a moderate load.....not idle.) So between Armoury Crate, fans, power settings and CPU spikes....... i'm sorry but I have to say no, do not purchase this gaming laptop. Save your money and checkout some other companies and hopefully you find something better than this!

Hope you appreciate the honest review and good luck in the hunt for a solid gaming PC

B0CR5SC51X,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,6 April 2024,the United States,False,"This is a very basic laptop. If you need something to surf the internet, check your email, check out social media websites, or other simple tasks like that, then this will work for you. If you want to do things that require a lot more memory or processing, then you are going to run into some issues. One of the first things I did not like is that they did not allow me to set up my own computer. This was already set up with an admin profile. That made me feel very uneasy. This laptop is extremely lightweight, but it also feels very fragile. I should mention that the quick start guide does mention that you should prevent this laptop from falling to the ground or being strongly impacted. It also mentions that it is only suitable for non-tropic areas below 2,000 meters. They don't want you to use it with a strong magnetic or strong static environment either. I think, however, the most worrisome precaution listed in the quick start guide is, ""Replacement with incorrect type battery may cause explosion."" Wow! :)
It does come with a mouse, but I did not try that out. The track pad and buttons work fine. Make sure to take off all the protective plastic. You will want to update Windows as soon as you get it connected to the internet. I did not have any trouble connecting it to my wifi. I tried the Tik Tok app, but I experienced lag when trying to move to the next video. Youtube was okay with it too, but again, at times I experienced lag. (I have a very high speed internet that does not lag with any of my other devices.) The screen was fine, but I had trouble with the sound. Even at the highest level, it was a bit difficult to hear at the highest level unless the room was completely silent.
Overall, I gave it three stars because it feels too fragile. One drop on the ground and you will probably render this laptop useless. This laptop would work for someone who needs to do basic tasks. I would not allow a young child or anyone who is irresponsible or clumsy to use this laptop without supervision. It's lightweight, so you can put it in a protective case or bag and take it with you to the library, a friend's house, or wherever you want. Considering that most lower end laptops with similar specs will cost about twice as much as this one, this is not all that bad of a deal.

The screen is literally the worst screen I've ever seen in real life. Laptops 10+ years older have a screen that blows this away. It actually hurts my eyes after about 30 minutes and that's never happened to me before. It is so hard to look at.

The whole thing is SUPER cheap. The keyboard layout is stupid and if you're used to a normal keyboard get ready to hit the wrong keys constantly.

There is no redeeming quality to this laptop. It's absolutely garbage DO NOT BUY. It's probably not even worth the aggravation trying to get everything off of it and return, so the best I can hope for is some good karma put out in the universe saving some other poor souls the misfortune of buying this POS.

Do not buy. You're welcome.

B0CPXPVGHD,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,11 April 2023,Mexico,False,"***Actualización del 20 de Julio del 2023:

En el canal icr4w de YouTube se explica como puedes configurar hasta 8TB de almacenamiento (Comprobado) y unos tips de los 64GB que tiene en memoria Ram, el método de configuración optimiza el PCIe como si fuera un Gen5 es decir velocidades increíbles de lectura y escritura en disco duro para lo que gusten, por cierto la batería dura en promedio solo 2 horas y se acaba :(

------------------------------------------------------

Compré el equipo y dejo mi reseña clasificada en varios puntos que para mí considero importantes:

Almacenamiento: El equipo viene con 1TB de espacio en NVME M.2 Gen 4 de Stock y trae un Slot extra para aumentar el espacio, la velocidad del disco de stock llega a los 5,000 MB de lectura y 4,500 de escritura, al equipo le puse un disco de 2TB WD_Black y le cargué nuevamente el sistema operativo aunque me costo trabajo encontrar el drives de Intel Rapid Storage Technology para procesadores de 13va Generación, al final lo encontré y le cargue Windows 11, en el Slot adicional le instale otro WD_Black de 2TB, en total quedo el equipo con 4TB y funcionan los dos discos a 7,000MB de lectura y 6,800 de escritura, según la página de Crucial con el número de serie del equipo se le pueden asignar hasta 4TB por Slot para tener en total 8TB (no comprobado por mi) ya que son muy caros los discos de ese tamaño pero con 4TB el equipo funciona perfectamente.

Memoria RAM: El equipo viene con dos módulos de 8GB de fábrica a 4800 MHz marca Samsung, yo al querer instalar más memoria en todas partes encontré que solo aceptaba 32GB como máximo, caso que me resultaba extraño al tener un muy buen procesador y prestaciones en generales altas, continué investigando y decidí investigar particularmente las características del procesador, en la Página de Intel ingresando el modelo del procesador que es el Core i9 13980hx indica que tolera 128GB en RAM en DDR5 a 5600 MT/s y lo mismo pero a DDR4 a 3200 MT/s y en la página de Crucial con el número de serie indicaba que toleraba 64GB con módulos de 32GB cada uno, así que me arriesgue y solicite en Amazon un paquete de 64GB que trae dos módulos de 32GB cada uno con las mismas especificaciones, DDR5 a 5,600 MT/s y los reconoció perfectamente, probé también dos módulos de 16GB para tener 32GB en total y también funcionó muy bien, al final me quede con los 64GB para tareas exigentes que la mayoría del tiempo quedan sobrados pero si tu duda en específico es si llega a 64GB de memoria RAM, si, si funcionan.

Procesador: El equipo viene con un Core i9 Raptor Lake específicamente el modelo 13980hx uno de los mejores del año 2023 de 13va generación, el procesador cuenta con 24 Núcleos, 8 de Rendimiento y 16 de Eficiencia, los proceso que e ejecutado en paralelo han sido creación de contenido, virtualizacion, ciencia de datos, videojuegos y realmente en nada me a fallado el único detalle fue que al reinstalarle Windows 11 en el disco de 2TB no aparecían las particiones para seleccionar el disco, hacia falta un controlador pero es para procesadores de 13va generación, encontré el de 11va y 12va generación pero solamente, si me tarde un poco al final lo encontré pero alguien que lo había publicado para una tarjeta madre de Asus para el procesador de dicha generación de esa forma lo descargue, lo cargue y detecto los discos, existe otra opción de desactivar el controlador VMD desde la BIOS pero no deseaba realizar esto ya que leí reseñas que tenerlo activo si le otorgaba un mejor performance al equipo, aunque si no encontraba el controlador era mi última opción, también leo que se podrían recuperar los controladores con Driver Magician del disco original y ahí debería de estar para poder buscar de carpeta en carpeta el controlador que solicitaba y poder instalar Windows esa era otra opción pero tenía que abrir el equipo nuevamente instalar el original, copiar todos los controladores, cargarlos en una USB y a intentar, sinceramente me daba flojera pero al final encontré el controlador y no hubo mayor falla con ello.

Pantalla: No es la mejor pantalla pero si es buena, en la página del producto existe una que es Nebula la cual tiene mayor frecuencia de actualización y mejores características, pero este equipo trae una pantalla con mejores prestación que la Nebula Display, aunque como digo es buena pantalla, tiene muy buen brillo y lo suficiente para jugar.

Tarjeta de Video: Incluye 8GB de memoria de video dedicada, la tarjeta de video que incluye es una RTX 4070 pero es la versión mobile, y no tiene el performance que una de escritorio, sin embargo lo primero que jugué fue Age of Empires II y luego probé algunos juegos como CyberPunk, Fortnite, Resident Evil, God of War y cabe decir que todo lo configura en calidad ultra o épica, y con el procesador de apoyo y sus 64GB en RAM pues en realidad ningún problema.

Teclado: Cuenta con Teclado RGB por tecla, el cual es configurable al color que gustes, no es algo que me llamara tanto la atención y nunca lo había usado, pero ya que lo use es un plus interesante y agradable.

Cámara Web: Cuenta con 720p en su cámara no es lo
mejor pero para lo básico es suficiente, de menos ya cuenta con ella, el modelo anterior no la incluía.

Energía y Batería: Incluye un poderoso cargador de 280w el cual le da el poder energético que necesita sin embargo el punto en el que más falla es en su batería, se drena en exceso y con mucha velocidad, no dura demasiado más que dls horas o tal vez menos pero por las prestaciones yo creo se podría entender un poco.

Precio: Costo 45k en pesos mexicanos y solo había promoción a 6 MSI.

Ventilación: Es silenciosa pero con muchas tareas el ventilador se escucha y en ocasiones fuerte y por algo de tiempo.

Peso: Es un equipo grande y pesado pero sigue siendo Laptop, si deseas portabilidad y algo ligero este equipo no lo es.

Envío: En total tardo 9 días desde que la pedí hasta que llego viene desde Hebron Kentucky EE. UU. y fue hacia la CDMX.

En general es un buen equipo, existe una versión con pantalla de 18 Pulgadas y 12 GB en la RTX así como pantalla Nebula, pero su precio a de ser mucho mayor más que no la encontré en Mexico, con un contacto la podía conseguir pero mencionó que su costo estaba entre los 60k y 70k.
Espero mi reseña les sea de utilidad, agregaré fotos para respaldar lo que comento y me extendí porque cuando quería saber más del equipo busque en YouTube y no encontré mucho, y tenía varias dudas al respecto.

Saludos.

B0CPXPVGHD,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,15 October 2023,the United States,False,"Product ID: G614JI-AS94.
Price: $1649.

Pros:

- Value. The I9-13980HX + GeForce RTX 4070 are a step above mid-tier hardware and are offered here at a reasonable price compared to other ""gaming laptops.""

- Performance. I've been able to play the newest and biggest games all on high / very high settings. I've had no issues, and I feel as if the games look and play great.

- Upgradability. I've NOT upgraded my machine as I don't wish to void the warranty. However, and as there was confusion in other reviews, I have personally spoken directly with ASUS support ,as well as Crucial support, and I've confirmed that YES this machine can be upgraded to 64GB of Ram (2x 32GB sticks) and YES there is an available open SSD slot. As such, and considering current prices of Ram and SSDs, you can scale this up to 64GB Ram and add second SSD for a D-drive for a minimal additional investment to really finish out this machine.

- Wifi. I get SIGNIFICANTLY better wireless Internet speeds on this device than the older gaming laptop I replaced. Did not expect that, but was pleasantly surprised.

- Sounds. Speakers sound good enough. Music through Spotify is crisp and bass gets picked up okay too.

Cons:

- Battery life. When playing a video game on battery power, I get about only 45-minutes of game time, which is disappointing. However, performance seems to remain higher than expected. When general web browsing or doing home office tasks, I get about 3 hours. When streaming content, such as Netflix, I about about 2 hours, which is frustrating as you can't really watch a movie on a single charge.

- Number pad. I was expecting a digital number pad or display as part of the track pad per the advertisement. This model number, G614JI-AS94, does not have that feature and that was very disappointing and seemed misleading.

- Touchpad. Doesn't feel as responsive as the touchpad on the older gaming laptop I replaced. Additionally, oftentimes after exiting a video game the touchpad will outright not work and require a device restart.

- Lights. As an adult, the multicolored lights are annoying and not something I'm interested in. It was not immediately intuitive on how to turn them off, but I found out that you can do so through the included software.

- Startup sound. It's awful and ear piercing! I can't figure out how to turn it off.

- Camera. Would have liked a better resolution here as it's not great.

Indifferent:

- Screen. I'm not a ""gamer"" so I don't really care or know anything about refresh rate. For me, it seems bright, clear, and things look good! However, I personally wish it was a 15.6 inch machine and not the 16 inch, as I'd prefer a slightly smaller and wider screen than this square.

- Ports. Good enough for me and has everything I needed. However, some people might wish for more options.

Conclusion:

If you're not a real gamer, but want to play games, this is a great option that offers value and performance along with upgradability.

Hay un error, totalmente culpa de asus y no de esta lap, que de la nada causaba un graphics error y tenías que reiniciar la laptop, esto se soluciona en el armory crate, desactiva algunas funciones de fondos personalizados (sobretodo los de navidad) y eso funcionó al 100, ya no he tenido ese problema en semanas.

B0CP7WK71B,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,19 March 2024,Germany,False,"Nach langer Suche nach einem leistungsstarken Laptop für Büroarbeit und Multimedia-Unterhaltung entschied ich mich für den MSI Prestige 16 AI Studio, und ich bin bisher begeistert von seiner Leistung.

Der Intel Core Ultra 7 155H-Prozessor und die GeForce RTX 4060-Grafikkarte haben meine Erwartungen übertroffen. Das Multitasking verläuft reibungslos, ohne jegliche Verzögerung. Auch die 32 GB LPDDR5 RAM ermöglichen ein müheloses Wechseln zwischen Anwendungen.

Das 40,6 cm (16,0"") QHD+-Display ist ein Traum für jeden, der viel mit visuellen Inhalten arbeitet. Die hohe Auflösung und die Farbgenauigkeit sorgen für ein immersives Erlebnis.

Was mich besonders beeindruckt hat, ist die Batterieleistung. Obwohl die angegebenen 16 Stunden nicht ganz erreicht werden, schafft der Laptop mühelos zwischen 8 und 12 Stunden, was für mich mehr als ausreichend ist. Ich habe bisher noch nie wirklich die gesamte Leistung getestet, da es noch nicht nötig war, das Gerät von 100% auf 0% laufen zu lassen. Es ermöglicht mir jedoch, den Laptop den ganzen Tag zu nutzen, ohne ständig an das Aufladen denken zu müssen.

Ein weiterer positiver Punkt, den ich erwähnen möchte, ist das leichte Gewicht des Laptops. Mit seinen kompakten Abmessungen und dem geringen Gewicht ist er äußerst mobil und lässt sich problemlos überallhin mitnehmen. Dies macht ihn zu einem idealen Begleiter für den Einsatz unterwegs oder in verschiedenen Arbeitsumgebungen.

Ein kleiner Kritikpunkt, den ich erwähnen sollte, ist das Gehäuse. Obwohl der Hersteller angibt, dass es sich um ein Metallgehäuse handelt, fühlt es sich etwas plastikähnlich an. Das mindert zwar nicht die Leistung des Laptops, könnte jedoch für einige Nutzer ein ästhetisches Anliegen darstellen.

Insgesamt bin ich jedoch äußerst zufrieden mit dem MSI Prestige 16 AI Studio Laptop. Er hat sich als zuverlässiger Partner für Büroarbeit und Multimedia-Unterhaltung erwiesen und bietet eine beeindruckende Leistung. Wer auf der Suche nach einem leistungsstarken Laptop für alltägliche Aufgaben und Medienkonsum ist, sollte definitiv einen Blick darauf werfen.

B0CP265X85,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 February 2024,the United States,False,"This is an excellent value for a budget notebook and I've bought and re-sold dozens of these from approximately September 2023 to February 2024. They are not perfect; in particular I wish that the least expensive model came with a more reasonable 500GB SSD rather than 250GB and that they keyboard didn't have the compact numeric keypad, but it does so many other things right that many budget notebooks get very, very wrong.

There's a solid build quality to the Ideapad 1. The chassis doesn't bend or flex, which is atypical among low-cost options. The keyboard is quite comfortable in spite of being off-center due to the aforementioned numeric keypad, and the touchpad is easily up to the standards of mainstream and premium devices, unlike those found in familiar low-cost offerings from Acer or HP. The display is very bright and lives up to the common Full HD (1920x1080) spec. It's not a super high resolution display, but it does display color faithfully and accurately. It has three USB type A and one type C port.

An AMD Ryzen 7320U won't exactly set the world on fire for performance, but it has four full-performance cores (8 threads), better-than-Intel graphics capability and substantially better power efficiency compared to the i3-1215U that is probably its most direct competitor. It's not ideal for content creation or gaming, but it's very well balanced for a ~$330 general purpose notebook. Another down side to this particular model is that it has soldered RAM rather than DIMMs. I suspect a lot of people would never even think to upgrade the RAM in a budget notebook and I do think 8GB is fair enough for the price.

As far as gaming goes, it's just OK for older games. Minecraft, Roblox and World of Warcraft players probably won't complain. It's just not a good choice for your Cyberpunk or Cities Skylines 2 needs.

B0CNY23Y1S,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,2 February 2014,the United States,False,"Very satisfied with this monitor: PIP was essential!

I bought mine in late September of 2011; I have never used the internal speakers, so I cannot comment on them. I am writing this now, because after 2 ¼ years of satisfaction with this monitor, I have just ordered a new PC, and have been reading the reviews to prepare myself for what may come, when I connect it to this.

My current PC is very old, and the drivers for its video adapter (an ALL-IN-WONDER 9600) are out of date, as are those for the motherboard. I have both VGA and HDMI ports connected; VGA to my PC and HDMI to a COMCAST / CISCO DVR. The ALL-IN-WONDER video adapter has software that makes connecting monitors almost foolproof, & it automatically detects the appropriate resolution settings.

The monitor's information screen indicates these parameters when those sources are selected:

VGA 1920X1080 67KHZ 60 HZ
HDMI: 1080i

I initially intended to connect the new PC via the DISPLAY PORT while keeping the old one on the VGA until I had copied all the files onto the new one's hard drive, but since then, see no need for that. Thus, I will connect it via VGA port. I will edit this review after the new PC is connected.

As I recall, when I first connected this to my PC, which at the time was set to 16xx by whatever, when I set it to its native resolution, there was a dead pixel. I was very disappointed, & returned the screen resolution to the lower setting, in preparation for reconnecting the old monitor. I shut down the system and was about to disconnect the cable, but for some reason, turned the PC on, again, & again selected the native resolution of 1920 x 1080. I found no dead pixels! I cannot account for why it had a dead pixel the first time, though having been an electronic technician for 10 years, I had seen some strange things. I knew where that dead pixel had been, & could not find it the 2nd time. I have been completely satisfied with this monitor ever since.

There are only 2 things I truly dislike: when the PIP is on, the audio source selector is grayed out. I had to run the RF out from the DVR through my VCR and out though its red & white phono jacks into a phono to miniature phone jack adapter & into the rear speakers of my 4 channel amplified speaker system.

The 2nd thing: when the screensaver turns the monitor off, it does not merely switch the screen off, but the audio also.

I have seen a few reviews that noted it has a tendency to wobble; I also found this true, but it is a minor annoyance.

Other reviews noted that the screen is VERY bright; I agree, but its default setting is:

BRIGHTNESS: 100%
CONTRAST: 87%

thus, it is set for very bright ambient light.

It also has COLOR TEMPERATURE settings; I selected COOL, set the brightness to 6% and the contrast between 43 and 50%, depending on what old movies I may be watching. If they are really faded, a higher contrast is needed, but this is rarely the case. Currently, it is 50%; I rarely need to chance these settings, though, because the contrast ratio is so very high. Watching old movies on my old GATEWAY monitor was not much fun, because the screen simply could not produce dark enough shades with its 1000:1 contrast ratio; yet, this ASUS monitor has a 10,000,000:1 contrast ratio, and I have yet to find a program difficult to see on this screen. As I write this, I have 2 CFL bulbs turned on; 1 is a 3-way equivalent 70, 100, 150 watt; it is bounced off the ceiling, & is usually the only one I use when watching movies, which I do from a distance of about 8 or 9 feet away from the screen. For shows with a lot of dark scenes, I sometimes switch the 3-way down to the 70 watt setting. The other is a 200 watt equivalent; both are aimed at the ceiling, and this indirect light is all I need. My room is not particularly bright, despite the bright bulbs, because they are aimed at the ceiling. When I used the 0% brightness, I used only the 3 way bulb, but for watching cable movies, sometimes the darker scenes were too dark. As I dislike constantly changing the settings, I finally settled on the 6% brightness & 50% contrast.

One reviewer complained that this monitor would not work at its native resolution when connected via VGA. I added a comment to that review, but will here say that the monitor has timing requirements at the various pixel resolutions / color depths; there is only 1 for the VGA input at 1920 x 1080; I assume this is an industry standard. The user's manual can be downloaded from ASUS' website's Customer Service page. Amazon deleted the link, but it can be found easily by searching the web for Asus + ve278q. The manual has been updated since I downloaded it the 1st time. It is in the .rar format.

It is not included in the package, though. It should be easy to compare one's video adapter's timing charts to the timing charts for this monitor, to ensure compliance between them. Though I am sure that the timing at 1920x1080 is a VGA standard.

HDMI: There are 4 compatible timing settings for the HDMI input at 1920x1080. When I switch to HDMI, I see a large message that clears away after a second stating that the monitor is not compatible with HDMI or some such thing, but it always clears away before I can even begin to read it. I am not sure if it comes from the DVR or the monitor, though I am leaning toward the former.

Viewing angles: I have no complaints here, as the screen is viewable from very wide horizontal angles; vertical are not so wide, but I can hardly see myself standing over it looking down.

IMAGE CLARITY: I am very impressed; I was watching MONSTER BUG WARS a year ago, & using the DVR remote used the zoom feature. I was astonished at the detail; which speaks highly of both the monitor & the DVR, not to mention the camera work. The color seems very accurate, though I have nothing against which to compare it.

EDIT (03/29/2014):

I have recently bought a new PC that has a displayport video output. I connected it with this cable (IM1-NZ7268 Accell B142C007B 656 DisplayPort to DisplayPort Cable, about $17). As I had read another person's review that found fault with the use of the DISPLAYPORT, I was a bit hesitant to use that connection. Yet, I found no such occurrence. Another reviewer mentioned something about a VESA COMPLIANT cable (which this is) not having the problem.

My Dell PC has a RADEON HD 8490 graphics card.

Cable: Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Accell-UltraAV-B142C-007B-2-DisplayPort-Locking/dp/B00CD1FB3A/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394161130&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=IM1-NZ7268+Accell+B142C007B+656+DisplayPort+to+DisplayPort+Cable

I am very satisfied with the performance of the monitor using DisplayPort; when streaming audio, if I turn off the monitor, the PC switches to its internal speaker. Obviously the monitor itself has nothing to do with this, and it may be a feature unique to Dell PCs, but I thought I would mention it, because I had earlier noted that because the monitor acts as a distribution hub for the audio (both HDMI & line-in) when it shuts off, the audio shuts off with it.
Above I had noted that the monitor does not allow selection of audio sources while in VGA; I thought it should allow selection of HDMI when using that as the source for the Picture in picture. There is no difference here while using displayport & HDMI in the PIP, though [Line-in] is available when displayport is used (as the main source) whether or not the PIP is on.
Note that when using HDMI, line-in is also available as the audio source.
GENERAL:
Other reviewers note that there is an annoying bleed of light at the very edges of the screen. This is only noticeable when the screen is very dark near the edges. My old Gateway monitor also had this effect. Anyway, I have not much noticed it actually affecting the pictures being viewed, though it is there. It does seem more or less noticeable as I alter the height at which I view the screen. lowering my chair a bit or leaning back makes the bleed at the bottom edge less visible.
In closing, you might want to start by reading the one-star reviews, as you may find something relevant to your situation. Spending $250+ may make taking the time well worth it.

B0CNY23Y1S,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,18 September 2011,the United States,False,"Pros: This is an excellent display for the price, very crisp and bright. Not a lot of graffiti on the bezel either, nice and simple. Not a single dead pixel to be found. Great connection options, every type you need. The built in speakers are decent, not great but certainly better than others I have heard and usable for sure. The power light is only an indicator of the state of the device, not a spot light/strobe light, hardly even notice it is there. Physical buttons, this may be a con if you are more into the newer touch type but I prefer the mechanical style myself. They run across the bottom of the screen facing down, out of the way and easy to use without drawing unnecessary attention.

Cons: I have noticed a bit of ghosting on fast moving objects. It isn't a lot, but you can definitely see it. I have adjusted the trace free setting from off up to max in an attempt to find the sweet spot. I have not been able to eliminate the effect yet.

Other Thoughts: You really can't go wrong with this monitor in this price range. The colors are vibrant and bright, whites are very pure while blacks remain invisible. I didn't have to do any adjustments out of the box, the thing looked great right away. It was at my door within a few days of ordering, always a pleasure doing business with you guys, thanks for the awesome LED monitor Amazon.

B0CNBD7TG7,Anonyme,2.0,Sans titre,10 January 2024,the United States,False,"The Yoga 7 16"" 2-in-1 was a nice attempt at delivering a decent lsptop, but the platform has several issues. First the Pros:
- big 16"" screen 1900x1600 UX
- decent sound if on hard surface
- Not overly heavy (~ 4 lbs)

Cons:
- TOUCHPAD: is crazily erratic. Trying to find a decent driver that allows a change in touch pressure/sensitivity proved impossible. It makes the mouse pointer disappear then show up at a random point on the screen. I bought a Lenovo digital touchpen hoping to improve the experience, but so little applications support it, it was a futile attempt.
- STORAGE SSD: Performance is SLOW. I frequently see SSD at 100% utilization. This could be contributing to touchpad being erratic.
- SUPPORT: is difficult to find, relying mostly on forums. Lenovo website gives you more marketing page navigation than technical support. Even then, you can get to the anemic forum and your specific computer's downloads.
- WINDOWS 11: likely has something to do with all of these issues since there are many complaints about Windows 11 alone, but poor support and recognition of problems by Lenovo shows that it was poorly integrated. (I used to be responsible for Windows Server preloads on a well known computer manufacturer AND the QA testing before customers saw it. It's not easy, but with some effort, it can make a great Out-Of-Box-Experience (OOBE))
- the NICE BIG 16"" SCREEN is unfortunately very glossy and shows a lot of what is over your shoulder behind you and a ghost of your face if there is any light. So the darker the room the better. Sunlight performance is awful.
- Screen usually flips with the orientation as you use it which is expected. But too many times after overnight with the lid closed, the screen has changed to ""portrait"" mode. It won't flip automatically, so you're left with trying to navigate with the crummy touchpad (oriented in Landscape) on a screen in portrait mode. While ""down"" is still down, it is on the RIGHT of the screen. When you stand the laptop on end, then you move the touchpad LEFT to go down. It's weird. Then you have to contend with WINDOWS 11 multiple screens and clicks while in the awkward navigation mode to finallt see in Settings that the screen is set to ""Portrait"". Who/What set that is completely unknown. This has happened many times and is at the least very tiresome. This is another bug from Lenovo.
- GRAPHICS performance is slow.

Unfortunately, once you use a computer bought on Amazon (and other places) long enough to find these things out, you can't return it. I would return it for a different brand and doubt I will try Lenovo again. I'm so underwhelmed and disappointed by this computer, but I'm stuck with it.

My DELL Inspiron 6500 laptop is nearly 15 years old and outperforms this one handily. It's just a lot heavier. I foolishly thought any new computer with a 3GHz clock speed and GPU would easily outperform the old 2.4GHz Intel. I was wrong on so many levels.

I would not recommend this laptop.

I could see lags, and drop in frame rates, and this isn't even from gaming, I was playing a youtube video.

Note, this is all from my one day experience using it. I immediately returned it the same day.
Lenovo I used to fight people to defend your brand, now I feel wrong and embarassed.

B0CLVPY37N,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,24 February 2025,the United States,False,"I have to explain a few things. I actually ordered this item by accident. I pressed the wrong button and ordered it (along with another item that I did not intend to order right away) and though I tried to cancel the order, the items arrived.

I decided to check out this item before sending it back. I really love its features. It is small and lightweight and great for travel. The screen does not have a very thick frame to it leaving more vision room on the screen. I would definitely recommend it even though I did not get to use it. Of course it can depend on what you would use a laptop like this for. I mostly do general computer things; I search for information on the internet, I read emails , I download documents and forms, I watch videos on YouTube; if I download certain programs or apps I can write and edit letters, or essays or take notes on WPS, or I can edit videos by downloading Windows Essentials and using Movie Maker.
I had to send this item back because I intended to spend money ordering something else, but I hope this item remains available on Amazon for a while because I think I would want to order it at a different time, maybe two of them.
I must say that since I actually did not get to use the item I cannot vouch for how fast the computer system is, or how rugged and long lasting the outer material is and how long the battery life of the computer is. I can only give it 4 out of 5 stars according to my initial impression of the item. But maybe when I do order this item at a later time I can give information on that.
But this seems to be an item that I want.

UPDATE APRIL 3 2025
I finally re-ordered the laptop. It seems good and in working order though I won't be using it full time right away. It has some tilt to the screen which is great for when the laptop is on your lap .
Seems great for travel even though you may have to tolerate a smaller screen.

I hope it will work properly for a long time.

I bought a laptop sleeve for it and I could not be happier with how easy it was to travel with this little thing. My wife always commented on the weight of my backpack and it was mostly the computer. it was so much heavier. In all fairness, it had a metal top and a 12hr battery, so it was going t be heavier. But this is so much easier to carry around. I do notice fingerprints a lot more and the battery life is not as long, but for the price, I'd buy it again and recommend it.

I had an Acer business laptop since 2018. It was a bigger, heavy-duty laptop and was also pretty heavy. I was on a cruise the month of March and it just died. I frustratingly searched for a lightweight computer with suitable power for my needs. So many processor options with too many versions of each. Then there was the question of RAM and storage and screens... I also really liked Windows 10 Pro but support for that is ending. Then I realized I don't need a workhorse computer anymore. I settled on this and got the 24GB RAM with 1TB SSD. I don't need the extra storage but I do like RAM. I was searching for a Ryzen 5 processor but in the end this Intel i3 gen 12 processor seems to be just fine for me. It was easy to setup and required about 20min to do. I like the speed and I really like the light weight. The keyboard feels nice. It is not backlit like my previous Lenovo and Acer, but I don't mind. I'm not blown away by the screen, but it is better than the screen on my previous much more expensive unit and fine for me. Also, the touchpad has a number pad feature that can be turned on and off. I think I'm going to like that. I have not tried to install any software yet. I do have Microsoft Office Home also purchased through Amazon (I previously had the pro version). I'm wondering if I'll ever need Office again. That's a decision I'll have to make before the return window closes.

B0CKN89X86,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,4 September 2024,the United States,False,"I waited a while (4-ish months) to try it more before making a review. I’m not good with describing, so forgive my lack of good words. I got the 16G + 1TB version. Came with laptop, charger, Windows 11 manual, mouse pad, usb wired mouse. The laptop was well protected & had plastic film adhered (inside & outside) to protect from scratches.
First, the laptop itself. The screen looks good & is vibrant for the cost. The keyboard is also good, it feels nice & the keys do not have a strong clack, but it’s not quiet either; I don’t think it will get annoying. The trackpad is okay, but I recommend a wireless mouse instead. Even though it came with a mouse, it feels cheap but works fine. The fingerprint ID is my favorite because it’s just easy to log in. The laptop itself is a bit hefty, more than a Chromebook, it feels sturdy like a legit laptop. Duh, I know, but sometimes other cheap laptops feel plastic-y & squeak when you press on it & just doesn’t feel secure, but this one does. On the downside, it is slim. It will heat up quickly because of the thin chassis. For this, I strongly recommend buying a laptop cooling pad (connects by USB & the fans are constantly cooling the laptop). Especially if you’re playing a graphic intense game or playing for long periods of time. For small or indie games it’s fine on its own. But for AAA games or open world gacha games, you will need the cooling pad & have it on low graphics. Can also do emulation. Came with windows office.
Before setting anything up or downloading any Windows updates & driver updates, I also strongly recommend having or making a Windows software back up usb drive. Because in my case, I think there was a clash when it was installing a Windows update & while also having to update the drivers, & something went wrong; I couldn’t get into recovery mode nor could I go in and uninstall the latest update. So I had to contact the seller and thankfully they sent me (took 2 weeks) a usb of a backup with video instructions, & after starting over, everything started working again (although I had to manually add the total memory in the memory partition because it was only showing 256gb of the total 1Tb memory). I was really worried because I didn’t have an extra PC to download the Windows software on a usb & I would’ve been screwed if they didn’t help me.
Conclusion: I recommend this PC if you’re looking for a stronger laptop than a Chromebook,
but less expensive than a higher end PC. Granted, you’re giving up on anything intense like high graphic AAA games, 4k+ video editing, thorough Photoshop, animation, music creation/editing. This is more for light or low-graphic gaming, Word office, internet browsing, music/movies. Also, the customer service is really good. For the money, it is worth it.

B0CJ2LBV19,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 November 2017,the United States,False,"Fantastic!

Not only did Amazon Warehouse Deals pull through in delivering a product that appears to be brand new, it was listed as ""Very Good"" condition with only damages to the box being the issue, but the monitor itself is in flawless working condition. Since it was delivered yesterday I have thrown a number of games at it including: Overwatch, Battlefield 1, Hitman: Season One, Aliens Vs. Predator, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Team Fortress 2, and Dishonored.

What I can say is that the 240hz refresh rate is no joke, if you have the CPU / GPU setup to reach the particular ceiling that this GPU sets then you are in for a treat! I was not hitting 240 FPS in Overwatch, but my i7-7700k, EVGA 1080Ti FTW3, and 16GB of DDR4 ram was getting up to about 220 and fluctuating down to about 170 while I was playing. The smoothness of the gameplay is the major selling point here, and coming from a 144hz monitor there is a noticeable change when going to 240hz; not major, mind you, more so a quality of life improvement that just makes aiming a little more precise / smooth.

Having watched a number of youtube reviewers of this monitor espouse that it is not really a necessary purchase, but more so a tool for pro gaming and people who are possibly too serious about their online FPS games holds some salt in my time with the monitor so far. The colors are great, definitely washed out a little with the brightness / gamma settings that come pre-set with the monitor, and the overall clarify is what you would expect for a Full HD 1080p monitor that is 24.5"". Comparatively speaking, having used Dell's 27"" 1440p / 1ms / Gsync monitor prior to this makes it somewhat hard to make the leap back to 1080p, but given the screen real estate you're given to operate with on the PG258Q it is not a major setback.

My real reason for getting this monitor was to enjoy the performance boost of gaming at 1080p and not having to contend with the faster depreciation of my hardware as a result of sticking with either 2K or 4K visuals. My humble opinion, I still think we are a little ways off from having super smooth gaming experiences at those resolutions without having to dial back certain graphical settings to get there. That was something I found myself having to do more often than not, even with a 1080Ti at 1440p, and that was not sitting well with me given how long it has been since I've owned a gaming PC. This time around I wanted to make sure that I could game at very high to ultra settings and this ASUS monitor can make that happen easily!

In closing, 240Hz / 240 FPS for most games is not a realistic or achievable goal with this monitor. You would most likely have to be running an SLI setup of some kind using multiple state of the art GPUs to make that happen. That said, when playing at 1080p and using a modern Intel processor coupled with a GTX 1080Ti, you can make magic happen with this monitor - even if you're not hitting that high FPS ceiling cap. Due to the high cost of this monitor I would recommend taking a gamble on an Amazon Warehouse Deal and try to secure one that is listed as ""Very Good"".

B0CJ2LBV19,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,9 January 2015,the United States,False,"Edit: Idk why Amazon turned the pics sideways. They're fine on my computer. Sorry. Anyways, they are there to show backlight bleed at factory settings which was bad, then with the brightness at 44, which is about normal, and it's gone.

Got my monitor yesterday, was worried it would arrive with problems. Soon as I turned it on, I checked it on the black screen for dead pixels and found none! Then checked for stuck pixels and found none! I was then very satisfied with the build quality. Checked out the backlight bleed and it was pretty bad at factory settings at the bottom of the monitor. After I put in some calibration settings, and dropped the brightness from 80 to 44 (it's a very bright monitor) the backlight bleed was non-existent and uniform. The stand came all assembled together, I just took it out, stood it up and plugged it in. Will be mounting to an ergotron arm, but if I didn't have it, I would leave the stand. It looks really nice! G-sync only works in fullscreen mode, which kind of bummed me out when I found that out, but doesn't really matter, because once you experience G-sync, it's unlike anything you've ever seen in gaming. There's no screen tearing, even on small objects like boxes. It looks like I'm playing a screenshot.

You'll need some hardware to really take advantage of this monitor though. At least a 770. Gsync will make 40fps feel like 60fps, it's so smooth. I have an i7 4790k, dual GTX-980s, 8GB of RAM.

Next to my 1440p Viewsonic VP-2770 IPS, it holds up well, but lacks the blacks of the IPS. If there was a gamma feature on this monitor, I'm sure I could dial it in even further. One review I read, had this monitor beating an Overload Korean IPS monitor in tests! I believe it was an e-IPS. My Viewsonic is an S-IPS I think. It's high quality.

Even though they just announced the ASUS ROG SWIFT 4K IPS 60HZ version will be released later this year, with a window of July-September, I still opted for this one. I will probably also get the 4K version, because I have the graphics power to drive it and the build quality is just fantastic.

Pros:
+1440p
+Build Quality is superb. Has to be seen in person to understand.
+Red ring on base of stand that can be turned on and off.
+Easy to navigate On Screen Display.
+Ultra Low Motion Blur
+Gsync does everything that Vsync does BETTER, without input lag. It's just glorious, if you've always hated Vsync (even if you like it, it still does Vsync's job but BETTER) but had to deal with screen tearing. That whole problem is now eliminated.
+1ms response time. In comparison to IPS, which at best is usually 5-6ms (new 4K IPS 60hz Swift to debut this year will be 5-6ms.) Response Time affects the amount of blur the monitor produces from changing colors.
+Super thin bezel makes this thing look as premium as it's price tag.

Neutral points: 8-bit color TN panel. Could be argued either way. It lacks the depth of IPS, but holds it's own well against it. Viewing angles are not a problem for me, even at this screen size. It's not your average TN panel. Can also be argued TN is better for fast paced action games, because it has faster response time and thus, less motion blur on the image.

Cons:
-Availability. When I build my PC back in September, this monitor was scarce and there was a lot of paranoia surrounding it. I just now got my order in, when they became available. Seems the newer batches are fine and getting way better user reviews.
-Can be argued it's not an IPS, but that's ok with me. It's way better than your average TN. Don't listen to people that don't own the monitor. They are just talking nonsense.
-Gsync doesn't work in windowed borderless mode YET! I believe they are working on solving this problem.
-Only ONE input and that's Display Port. So if you plan on using this monitor for something like a video game console on the side, forget it! I still have my Viewsonic, and hopefully the NEW Swift to release this year has multiple inputs.
-Price is steep, but for what is in this package, it's not that bad. People crying about the TN panel just don't understand. It's TN but it's 8bit color. You're paying for the resolution, build quality, size, and gsync (most of all. I believe this little module runs $200 itself. They are working on getting that price down, but it's in such a high demand, it's hard to.)

Conclusion: Terrific monitor. I was scared ordering one, but I don't believe I can go back. This is THE definitive gaming monitor on the market at the time of the review. There are some monitors coming from competitors, like Acer, with 144hz IPS gsync, but it's not really an IPS panel. It's an AHVA panel. Do your homework on these monitors! I STILL am totally satisfied with this monitor based on it's build quality ALONE. I was on the fence about the 4k IPS they have coming this year, but I'll definitely be getting one, maybe a few months after release like I did with this monitor.

ASUS is a big company, with a lot of business, in comparison to other companies. They thus are going to have more negative reviews because they are moving more product. I've heard bad stories about their customer service, so if I were you, I would try to purchase the amazon warranty with this monitor.

B0CHZH2H7W,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,16 November 2022,Mexico,False,"Muy bonita laptop, la pantalla se ve muy bien y se siente bien La batería dura bien, nada extraordinario pero buen batería y carga rápido. Además, la propia computadora a través de MyAsus cuenta con un modo de protección de pila que limita su carga al 80% de su capacidad para proteger a la misma y que dure más, de todas formas recuerda no dejarla conectada por mucho tiempo. Es relativamente ligera, fácil de transportar y se siente premium, el cuerpo es mayoritariamente de plástico pero parece ser que la pantalla cuenta con cuerpo de aluminio, lo que le da buena apariencia. El rendimiento es bueno, me permite buenas multitareas sin bugeo. Aún no la pruebo para juegos pero actualizaré cuando tenga tiempo de probarlos. En cuanto al modo tableta y el touch, los gestos funcionan bien, pero a veces el touch puede fallar un poco, cómo que no se reconoce o se reconoce de manera espontána sin toque, sin embargo me he dado cuenta que esto solo pasa en Youtube pantalla completa. Además, hay sitios web y algunas aplicaciones que no están bien optimizadas para el touch. Ej. la página de la NFL no admite entrada táctil, o Adobe que si aceptada entrada táctil pero se siente mal optimizada y poco fluida. En cuanto a los programas de Office el touch funciona completamente normal, igual en sitios como YouTube (salvó por el comentario anterior), Crunchyroll, Netflix, Star, Dinsey+, pero a veces se puede sentir un poco la falta de optimización. Cuenta con teclado retroiluminado y el panel táctil del mouse tiene un botón para activar un teclado numérico bastante útil. El desbloqueo con huella no es la gran cosa, traté de configurar mi huella pero el lector no funciona de manera muy adecuada, la desbloqueo de manera convencional, es más rápido. El nivel de brillo no es la gran cosa pero se ve muy bien en interiores, no así, los reflejos aumentan con la iluminación ambiental y claro en exteriores. De igual manera la pantalla se ve muy bien y ya me la han chuleado. Aún no he modificado nada, pero parece ser que cuenta con una ranura extra para memoria RAM. La cámara cuenta con bloqueo físico. Viene con teclado extranjero, no cuenta con Ñ pero se puede configurar el teclado a LATAM, solo que las teclas no van a corresponder con los carácteres especiales (no letras), aunque puede ser tantito molesto solo es acostumbrarse. El cuerpo se ve un poco más grueso de lo que esperaba, pero igual es delgada y se ve elegante. Las bisagras se sienten firmes y resistentes y permiten varios ángulos.

Lo malo, las bocinas no están tan buenas a pesar de ser Hardman Kardon, al principio se escuchaban bien y no les daba un uso excesivo, pero cuando las usaba si lo hacía con el volumen algo alto, así que cuidado con eso porque dos semanas bastó para que las bocinas ""reventaran"" y ahora si se escuchan pero con algo de estática. EDIT Parece ser que el problema de las bocinas tenía que ver con la BIOS, para que el sistema funcione bien la BIOS debe estar debidamente actualizada. Así lo hice y tras la actualización las bocinas volvieron a funcionar de manera normal, si se escuchan muy bien pero nada extraordinario. Sin embargo, apartir de esta experiencia me he enterado que la laptop no cuenta con forma de hacer válida la garantía ya que es producto de E.U.A y las políticas de la Asus en México con cubren garantías de productos que no hayan sido exportados por Asus México. Así que mi laptop funciona normal y es excelente para uso diario multimedia y productividad, pero no tiene respaldo de garantía. Si hubiera algún otro mal aspecto sobre estás laptop, mencionaria el hecho de tener que limpiar la pantalla con frecuencia pues me encanta usar el touch.

En general una excelente compra, no me arrepiento pero probablemente adquirir un seguro para la misma no sería mala idea en caso de accidentes.

B0CHZH2H7W,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,17 July 2023,the United States,False,"so ive waited a good while to write this review. I absolutely hunt and grind when im looking for a product to buy and i will look at every single aspect of a device before i make a decision.
1. screen quality:
the screen is relatively bright and indoors i have no real issues with glare. the resolution is high enough that i dont feel a need for more. no dead pixels but i will say color is NOT a strong point for this laptop. im not a content creator and even i feel the transition from my desktop to this laptop jarring when it comes to colors. the default wallpaper makes it look god but even on the vivid preset, it is quite washed out. nout a deal breaker but not color accurate by any means.
2. Battery life:
so i havnt reach the full extent of the battery because i immediatly enabled the battery life saver that stops charging at 80% and i consider 30% to be dead so right away i lose 50% of max battery and still i get about 3 and a half hours with typical school use which is browser tabs with max brightness so pretty solid. it charges quickly with the included 90 watt charger and even my aftermarket 65 watt charger charges it form 30 to 80% in 1 hours while using it.
3. Performance:
Performance has been great so far. i havnt pushed it to its absolute max but it can handle light gaming and even modern games if you crank the settings down. the heat that comes out on heavy use is intense but under light use the fan doesnt even kick on so it stays cool and silent in most use cases.
4. keyboard:
Keyboard is good enough for what it is. this entire review was typed on the laptop without too many issues. the backlight is busted by default, there is a setting in the included asus software that fixes the backlight not changing with the function key. under customization, input device settings set function key lock to normal function key uses and it will work as expected.
5. Upgrades:
so far i have upgrades the ram to 24gb with a single 16gb stick and a swapped the included wifi card with an intel one and that helped with the slow connection to wifi on startup. the would be about a 30 second delay after boot where there would be no internet. the ssd can be swapped with a larger 2210 but the 512gb is enough for me and its plenty fast. very easy to open and clean.
conclusion:
i absolutely love this laptop. ive never owned a relatively modern laptop and this is an amazing first start. i hope it holds up for many years to come

B0CHZH2H7W,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,19 December 2023,the United States,False,"I was looking for a basic, everyday browsing online laptop and this fits the bill perfectly. Purchased for $380. If it was any more expensive, I would probably skip it. For the price, it provides great value. From start up to web browser, it was under 10 seconds.

Specifics: I am very particular when it comes to keyboard and touch pad. This has been a great laptop to just type on! The touch pad is decent enough to not mind. Battery life was an important factor for me. Considering that I only use this for browsing online, etc. it has given at least 4 hours of constant browsing. A lot of reviewing mentioned battery as a concern or issue, but it varies significantly depending on your use case. Sound quality is what you would expect from a lower priced laptop. I am not an audiophile, but the sound will suffice. Doesn't sound great obviously but gets the job.

Overall, I believe this is a great starter laptop with fast performance, high build quality, and strong everyday performer.

Important note: This laptop was easy to open with the right tools (iFix It Laptop Kit) and I upgraded the memory with an 8GB DDR 3200Mhz CL22 stick. Now totaling 16GB in memory, this laptop performs even better.

B0CGJGZZ1L,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,16 November 2023,the United States,False,"For the price point this laptop delivers an amazing amount of value. I hadn't considered Chromebooks before because I thought of them as underpowered machines that could only do the most basic tasks, but that definitely isn't true here. This laptop boots up within seconds and runs extremely smoothly even when handling a lot of different browser tabs and apps at once. I'm sure it wouldn't be able to compete with computers like a Macbook Pro if you threw computationally intensive tasks at it (video editing, etc.), but it would be unreasonable to expect that at this price point.

The touchpad is very generously sized and the keyboard is very comfortable and has a good amount of travel, which I prefer to the flatter keyboards on Macbooks. USB-C charging is also a nice touch as you could use a phone charger on this laptop in a pinch. The construction is plastic, not metal, but it feels very solid and I expect it to hold up well. If you are an Android user, there are a lot of useful integrations with your phone. The availability of many Android and Linux apps (for developers and open source enthusiasts) also opens up a lot of possibilities.

Overall, I'd highly recommend this computer as long as you don't absolutely need apps that are only found on Windows or Mac.

It has state of the art Bluetooth capabilities and, importantly for me, allows you to hook up any Bluetooth mouse. At 14""'s, the screen is large and clear.

We’ve had nothing but issues since the day they arrived. One of them had a really loud grinding noise whenever it was running since the day we got it. The seller refused to help and Acer support just wanted us to ship it to them and said it could be 3 months to get it repaired and returned. We decided to return it and buy another one thinking it was a one off manufacturing defect. The replacement unit has had so many issues we’ve had to reinstall windows every few months to keep it working. And now 11 months later the screen stopped working. We brought it to a repair shop. They replaced the screen and wiring and it’s still not working. They are now thinking the only possibility left is the circuit needs to be replaced which is going to cost $800! Garbage…,0

From what I can tell it broke while I was picking up. It was closed so I am not sure that is when it happened but nothing happened to it that should have caused the screen to break. There is no damage to the outside or to the screen itself. The damage is internal to the screen. Lenovo is sending it back to me unrepaired.,0

""Wow those are great specs for so cheap"". Yeah the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" applies here. Massively.

It is SO slow. May as well have 1g of ram. No setting optimization fixes this. NOTHING works properly. Everything is so buggy and crashes often. I bought this to run quickbooks for a business and my 85 year old book keeper was making fun of me for how slow it was and how I shouldn't have cheaped out and bought this POS.

Yeah imagine an 80+ yr old man complaining about how slow a ""new"" computer is. It's that bad and worse.

The screen is literally the worst screen I've ever seen in real life. Laptops 10+ years older have a screen that blows this away. It actually hurts my eyes after about 30 minutes and that's never happened to me before. It is so hard to look at.

The whole thing is SUPER cheap. The keyboard layout is stupid and if you're used to a normal keyboard get ready to hit the wrong keys constantly.

There is no redeeming quality to this laptop. It's absolutely garbage DO NOT BUY. It's probably not even worth the aggravation trying to get everything off of it and return, so the best I can hope for is some good karma put out in the universe saving some other poor souls the misfortune of buying this POS.

Do not buy. You're welcome.

B0CDTT6DTW,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,28 April 2025,the Netherlands,False,"This beautiful model (HP ZBook Firefly 16 inch G10 - 6B8S6EA#ABD) from HP caught my attention in the first week of April. Amazon offered a retourdeal for only 639,73 euros but for that price it comes with an imperfection of +- 6mm on the outside. I wrote an e-mail to the customer service to make some verifications about the guarantee and the keyboard. They told me that it has a QWERTY keyboard but the laptop that I received last week has a QWERTZ (Germany) keyboard. In the beginning I was disappointed about this and after contacting the customer service I thought it seemed logical to send it back. What I didn't know then is that it can take up to 2 or 3 weeks before your money is returned. That's quite long if you are in need for a laptop and you want to buy one as soon as possible. Yesterday I decided to start up the machine to see if the screen has any flaws or damages. The battery was completely empty so I had to charge it first to be able to see if it works and to look for any problems with the screen. Till now after checking the laptop from above to below I didn't find anything that looks slightly damaged or imperfect. The box it came in looks used and the battery charger was wrapped up like somebody didn't take the time to do it the right way but this HP ZBook Firefly 16 inch G10 looks like it's in PERFECT shape. According to the website from HP the guarantee is still about 15 months (enter serial number) and Amazon gives a guarantee or warranty of 1 year. In both cases it's a great deal for such a beautiful laptop. Right now I am very happy that I didn't send the laptop back to Amazon because at the moment I turned it on and saw what a WONDERFUL screen it has I forgot about the German keyboard layout. One of the advantages of this model are the extra security measures like HP Wolf Security and some special hardware features. It has an aluminum chassis and is MIL-STD-810H certified.

B0CDQTSSTR,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,11 February 2025,the United States,False,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift. Computer did not perform as expected and was extremely slow and/or would freeze. Had issues installing Microsoft apps— install would stall and not complete. When apps ran they would lag.

Tried to join a teams call for my child… opened teams an hour before the call to make sure everything would would load and it seemed fine. Fifteen minutes before the call, opened teams to enter the call details. Camera was not loading and preventing me from joining the call as the teams app froze during the process. Finally, just as the call was supposed to start, I was able to get into the call. However, despite making sure I was not on mute and camera was toggled on ( I have been using teams for business calls on a daily basis for the past 3 years, so I’m super familiar with it). Person on the line could not see our hear us. I couldn’t even close the app to try and reconnect. I ended up having to use my cellphone, which connected quickly with no issue. About 30 min after I initially started logging on for the call, I finally had to close the app through the task manager.

A brand new computer with these specs should not struggle like this. My 5 year old laptop should not perform better than this laptop. I ended up returning the computer. Paid $350 for the computer and had to pay $65 restocking fee, which is ridiculous for something that was defective out of the box.

I will never buy an item like this off Amazon. Ended up buying a similar laptop through Costco knowing they stand by the products they sell and will refund or replace and item at no charge if it is within the return window if it is defective.

B0CDH3FXQG,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,6 February 2025,the United States,False,"This is a great little gaming laptop. Outputs 4K through the HDMI port when I hook it up to the TV, runs nice and clean, the LEDs are a lot of fun. I also do a large amount of my writing on it as a published author. Had it a few months, and the LEDs stopped working properly and there is something loose knocking around in one of the fans when they ramp up during a game. No big deal, I'll send it off under the warranty. I call Asus to find out that the warranty expired in October of 2023, and I bought it new in August of 2024. So now I'm having to send them a copy of my invoice before I can even get an RMA, otherwise I literally have a new laptop with no manufacturer's warranty. Gave it 3 stars because it is a great machine, and I feel like I'm being pretty generous only knocking off two stars considering I paid over a grand for a laptop with an expired warranty.
UPDATE: If you are going to purchase this unit, do NOT buy it from this seller. They are not an authorized reseller, and Asus will not issue any coverage on the unit even with a proof of purchase. The LED strip on the bottom has stopped working, though the fan thing resolved itself. Here is the literal response I got when I offered to open the casing and send them a pic of what it looks like on the inside since it doesn't have a warranty anyway: ""Hello,
Thanks for your response.
We are sorry for any inconvenience you may be experiencing.
We suggest you not remove the bottom of the casing to check the LED strip issue.
Could you please kindly let us know if the laptop can work normally except for the LED strip?
If the laptop can work normally, could you please kindly keep the laptop and ignore the LED strip issue? and we would like to offer you a $50 refund for the inconvenience caused to you.
Please feel free to contact us if you have any more concerns.
Thanks for your understanding and patience.""
So, to recap: I've been back and forth with these people for a week. Amazon will not do anything to help because this seller did not use them to fulfill the order (great looking out for your customers, Amazon), Asus won't do anything because (as far as they're concerned) I bought it at what amounts to an online garage sale, and the solution they have is asking me to ignore the issue on a ""new"" $1200 laptop and pay me $50 to do so. Needless to say, I have documented everything and I am going to dispute the charge. This is a rip-off, and Amazon will not help you if you purchase from this seller. Taking the review down to 1 star. It's a good little unit. Defects happen. The 1 star is because of what I have had to go through to have the working unit that I paid for. They fix it, I'll fix the review. Until then, this is a brief summery of my experience with both this seller and Amazon.
Update: The seller is asking me for more pics of the unit and still insisting that Asus will re-up the warranty with the proof of purchase even though I have explained to them that Asus will do no such thing. I sent them a copy of the email along with more photos. They also offered to repair the unit if I ship it back to them as they have a tech department in their warehouse. This seller has no website and no other information than a phone number that goes straight to voicemail. I explained that the only place I would be willing to ship the laptop is Asus. I have disputed the charge and I have also sent copies of the transcript between me and Holiday Electronics Deal to the credit company. I have also reported this to Amazon.

B0CD79S1M6,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,1 April 2024,the United States,False,"Just as described except this is not Type-C USB this is in fact Type A USB and the laptop works well for the most part, it's very stable but I did experience a problem when it goes to sleep with high RAM usage, having it go to sleep with high RAM usage seems to cause the CPU fan to fail at speed regulation, it began to buzz and fails to spin correctly. Restarting from this condition occasionally fails to locate the boot drive. A full power off is required to fix it. This could be entirely a Windows issue and may not be the fault of the laptop. I'm not actually sure what the cause was but it cleared up and the laptop runs well again. Most people won't experience this issue as most people won't push it to it's limit of RAM the way I do.

There's many things I like and a couple things I didn't like so much. One problem I experience is with the touch pad, it's responsive, just too large for my liking, and the left/right buttons are flush with the pad making them difficult to press, but this isn't really a deal breaker for me. I could live with it, and even plug in an external mouse which I might do.

The keyboard is responsive and works well, I just wish the keyboard LED light would remain on. It has a timer and turns off the light which is not so great in my opinion.

The battery lasts a few hours, it's just difficult to access for the regular user who might want to replace it someday.

This laptop is lightweight which is great but this also makes it feel fragile to me. The case is a bit of a mystery to me, it feels cheap and somewhat flexible but at the same time appears to be well made. The screws that hold it together go into a metal screw mount instead of directly into the plastic which makes it less likely the screws would strip and fall out easy. The fact that the manufacturer took the effort to add metal inserts for the screws to go into is a big plus to me.

It has one 16Gb RAM module, The hardware reports that it is capable of two modules but upon inspection I could only find one slot.

The CPU is soldered on to the board so it cannot be replaced or upgraded by most people unfortunately. But that being said It's much faster than I had expected for a Celeron.

The CPU is in ""Turbo Mode"" set in the BIOS. it's a 2.00Ghz running at 2.8~2.9Ghz with turbo. Turbo can be disabled and it's still a pretty quick laptop at the default 2.0Ghz

The laptop boots quickly from it's m.2 SATA drive, programs install and open swiftly and it has no issues browsing the Internet, listening to music, or watching streaming videos online. It's a very good laptop for general productivity.

It can even play a popular and well known 3D Anime game if the graphics are set to lowest and the resolution is set to 1024x768

It can run Linux, I tested it with Linux mint which it ran perfectly fine.

I feel kind of bad for the laptop because there's a lot of un-branded or un-named components that were simply left as ""DEFAULT STRING"" in the American Megatrends BIOS. I feel like Trion should change these to look more professional, custom and less generic. The seller doesn't offer any support or have any understanding of laptop technology, don't expect customer service.

It has okay stereo sound that works but isn't really the greatest. I use external Bluetooth earbuds anyway so it's not a problem for me.

It's a suitable laptop for daily tasks, quick and stable for email, movies, photo editing, spreadsheets, shopping, much anything except demanding gaming or similar tasks.

B0CCRNWG6D,Chris Wood,5.0,PB278QV - very happy with it.,14 November 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"This review is of the ASUS PB278QV 2560x1440 monitor.

Basically, I can't really fault it. The display is crisp, colours good, no dead pixels (there are web sites that let you test this). I'm a keen photographer and my photos edited to 2560x1440 look beautiful (am I allowed to say that??). The only criticism I could have is that the speakers are really tinny sounding, but this is typical of built-in speakers, and since I have no intention of using them it doesn't matter to me.

Some reviews say it runs hot (mine doesn't), they have dead pixels (mine doesn't), the colours are washed out (try the saturation control?), poor viewing angle (looks OK to me). The only real gripe I have is that the support stalk at the back doesn't quite fit under the shelf at the back of my desk, so stopping me pushing it back an extra 4 cm - I mean, you'd have thought that the ASUS designers could have taken that into account..... :-)

Here's some information perhaps not covered by others...

In the box: both UK & continental power leads, DP & HMDI cables (no DVI). The monitor has inputs (1 each) for DP, HDMI, DVI, VGA, audio. The speakers work with HDMI and DP (they have integrated sound), with DVI and VGA you'd need to use an additional audio connection.

I run a Linux Mint setup with a relatively old Sapphire Radeon 7750 graphics card which supports a max resolution of 2560x1440 via DVI, which was what I was planning to use. But it also supports DP and since the monitor came with a DP cable, I'm using that. It works beautifully.

The OSI is not very intuitive but you get used to it. There are a set of preset modes (strangely called the ""Splendid"" setting) that encapsulate the brightness, contrast, sharpness, colour etc, some editable, some fixed.
I found most of these presets too bright for everyday use so I edited one of the modes I wasn't going to use (Game mode) and lowered the brightness and contrast to a level I found comfortable.

You can tell that I'm pretty happy with this purchase.

B0CCRNWG6D,HectorSpace,5.0,Great display quality and all you apps open in one screen,10 July 2022,the United Kingdom,False,I really like the display quality of these monitors. The resolution and colour match is excellent. The amount of desk top apps space these monitors provide is just right! Especially if you're working all day everyday in software dev. So good I came back for a 2nd one!,0
B0CCRNWG6D,dave_bass5,4.0,"Love it, but is it worth it?",28 October 2021,the United Kingdom,False,"Ok, so this review is being written after just 24 hours of owning it, so no long term report.
I do photo editing as a hobby, mostly Lightroom. Also a bit of design and music creation. I work for a printers so good colour accuracy is something i expect, although it doesn't have to be perfect. This is for home use with a Windows 10 PC.
First impressions were warm. The Bezel is larger than i thought, but not a deal breaker. The screen arrived with the large back panel hanging off and loose. It took me a while to snap it back on but its on and no harm done.
No light bleed (although i can see IPS glow). No dead pixels which is a relief. Love the stand although not so much the fact that it rotates. Ill never use that, but im sure some will. Nice to have a decent stand for this price i guess.
This is replacing an old Dell 24” IPS monitor, and a AOC 27” 4k that ive been borrowing. I liked the idea of 4K at first, but never felt it offered an image as good as my smaller and cheaper Dell. Size wise its perfect though, but text on the AOC was never sharp, due to scaling i guess. I almost went for a 27” FHD, but thought 2K would give me more leeway, while avoiding scaling and image degradation.
Most of my graphics and Lightroom work are done on a 2020 12.9”iPad pro, as its more convenient and more powerful than myPC, but im really impressed that images look almost identical on both the Asus and iPad. Life got easier and ill use my PC a bit more now.
No issues getting 75Hz with Windows 10. Not sure why others say it doesn't work.

As the last time i brought a monitor (the Dell) was about 15 years ago im not sure if the Asus is value for money or not. There are plenty of similar featured monitors that have 100% sRGB that cost less, look better and have all the features i need. It was a hard choice, but i have no regrets buying the Asus. Its a keeper and im sure il get many years of enjoyment from it. I dont think id replace it with another if i had to, maybe something with a thinner bezel next time, but for now im very happy.

B0CCRNWG6D,haro112,5.0,An extremely beutiful image and the 75hz is a very nice bonus!,21 April 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"This is an epic monitor! The 2k quality can be noticed and the 75hz is great for gaming, though you need to download geforce experience to utalise this. £250 is a great price for this monitor, which is what I paid for it. The buttons on the monitor are firm and are unlilely to break anytime soon. The only thing I would say is that the monitors speakers are a but tinny but considering they aren't necessary and there is an audio output port, alongside an headphone jack, it is a very mild thing to find unwanted. If your looking for a monitor for gaming this is an excellent on. Unless of course you really want a 144hz monitor, which in my view is the only alternative that would be worth the money for gaming. In my view however, 75hz is enough and the 2k is extremely beloved to me. It's such a gorgeous image and with very customizable monitor settings from its button commands, it's a great buy.",6

B0CCRNWG6D,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,19 June 2020,Italy,False,"Probabilmente il miglior monitor 27"" 2K a 75hz sul mercato. Alta risoluzione, estremamente luminoso, arrivato senza pixel morti, LED IPS con ottima fedeltà colore, vetro opaco, ottimo stand regolabile in altezza e inclinazione (solamente la rotazione può risultare noiosa in quanto rotea anche la base).
Ha la funzione per limitare la luce blu ed effettivamente, come dicono anche le altre recensioni funziona benissimo.
Ottimo anche il menu delle impostazioni, ben ordinato e con tasti comodi.
Cavo HDMI e Displayport sono dati in dotazione.

Le casse audio integrate non sono il massimo; Una banale cassa portatile bluetooth da 20w riesce a rimpiazzarle meglio.
Le cornici del pannello sono belle spesse. Chiaramente parliamo di un monitor che è in commercio da un bel po' di anni, quindi si porta dietro un design superato. Se non vi interessa il fattore estetico, rimane sicuramente la vostra migliore opzione, secondo me.
Una cosa a cui fare attenzione sono invece i consumi. La categoria è B, non è proprio un vampiro ma consiglio comunque di spegnerlo quando ci si assenta dal pc. Ho notato anche che il pannello dopo un qualche decina di minuti inizia a scaldare parecchio nella parte inferiore; Mi auguro non porti ad effetti collaterali nel lungo periodo.

In sostanza un ottimo prodotto, secondo me il migliore di questo tipo se non avete esigenza di andare a 144hz o 4k.

But that's where the romance ended. I've had the laptop for 3 days now and to be honest, nothing like I expected from ASUS.

I started working with computers in the 80-column punch card days. I've programmed over the years, been a ""System Analyst"", started working internet before internet was in homes, coded with Notepad, integrated data-bases so it's not my ""stupidity"".

I've used Mac, Lenovo, Toshiba, Dell, HP laptops. NEVER have I EVER been so disgusted as I am today. To think I thought about this purchase for 3 months. Oh well...

First, it took THREE hours to simply get it started and that's not including the initial battery charging (which was expected). THREE HOURS of ""updating"" (as Windows is notorious for). Shutting down, restarting, setting all sorts of software that I didn't want and will never use.

There was no ""manual"" or documentation. Everything required searching the web. The ""function"" keys are ridiculously convoluted. Some require ""control"", others ""function"". Many need the number keys locked, others need them unlocked. There's nothing intuitive about the keyboard.

Examples: ""end"" and ""home"" are on the number keypad and the ""NumLock"" has to be engaged and disengaged to use either. And as I type, the ""overwrite"" and ""insert"" functions seem to randomly engage and disengage. You have to watch the screen to make sure you don't type over something already typed.

The touchpad seems sensitive to the vibrations of typing and suddenly, paragraphs are ""selected"" and one key-stroke and they vanish because the cursor was moved because of the sensitivity. Really bad when building code for web-sites (which is the majority of my work).

It's too annoying and time-consuming to return this, and I've been doing my best to ""adjust"" to the differences. But bottom line: I'm starting to save up for another lap-top because ""product quality"" doesn't look promising. It's not what I expected from ASUS. I've used other ASUS laptops in the past. This one seems to be their ""bottom line"".

As for the keyboard, the touch is ""tinny"". Typing sounds and feels like this laptop isn't going to last for very long. Compared to my old Dell, this machine feels more like a child's toy and the keys feel like they'll be popping off with much use.

Editing 8 days after receipt:
The ""function"" keys (for typing symbols) are non-existent. One MUST use the ""Map"", copy and paste.
The touchpad can't be disengaged whilst typing so the cursor is all over the place trying to type a document AND often, highlights and erases paragraphs with no indication that it will or has done. (PROOF READING REQUIRES AS ONE TYPES). ONLY option: turn the touch pad off... and for that... A MOUSE IS NECESSARY!
The screen dims at whim... you'd think you were going blind, and there's no ""control"" setting to stop it.

And the battery? Lucky if I get 4 hours of plain typing... with NO other application open/running.

If this is ""Asus"" and Asus is supposed to be superior to Acer... I'm almost wishing Toshiba was still available (and I had one of those nightmares too).

Don't torture yourself. Buy something else (like a ""Yankee Clipper"" typewriter.)

This has NOTHING to do with the Seller. As I say, the lap-top arrived so timely and well packaged.
But I'll never buy another Asus product again. And it's too much of a head-ache now to return this and have to get another lap-top and move files, reconfigure...
Sorriest purchase I've made in a great long while.

(And this probably won't ever be published because it's too honest.)

However... 2 days in and all updates completed (which were supposed to be done before shipping), and I could not get my Samsung Buds to be discovered for pairing (no problems with other laptops or android phones), and could not get it to pick up the Spectrum wifi pod, so it sits with a single weak bar of wifi while my work laptop 2 feet away enjoys full wifi signal.

I ended up having to return this laptop and was surprised to not be refunded the Assurian extra insurance that I paid for and also was refunded over $200 less than I paid, which I don't understand when the return was approved in advance by Amazon. So, I'm out over $400 in all. Something is just not right here.

1. Opens with ""Country of Origin"" window and you get stuck there.
2. Called the phone number on the box ""if there is an issue call this number"" only to be told that's it the wrong number and then I was given two more phone numbers to try.
3. Called the second phone number, had to find the model and serial number which is the world's smallest type font! After that the next first few suggestions didn't help! Then they had to email me so I could take a picture of the screen and email it back to them which takes them 5 minutes for them to receive it.
4. Finally after hitting the ""F6"" key and the ""Fn"" key simultaneously I was able to get out of that window.

This is just my personal opinion. Do not buy this laptop. The Intel in this laptop is bottom of the line. I didn’t know it when I purchased. I have been told by a personal laptop specialist that it’s like putting a lawnmower engine in a car.
In addition, the hinges on the lid are broken and just a matter of time before lid and screen breaks away from base/keyboard completely. Would cost more to fix than buy a new one. Of course, the warranty just expired end of this July 2024, and I didn’t pay for $100 for another year. Don’t know if would have done me any good anyway.
I feel like I just threw away $600.00.
As a side note, I’m not saying all Dells are bad. I’ve had a desktop since 2005 that still runs. Runs slow but still runs.

Update: 08/14/2023
With the help of Amazon and Dell, this registering issue has been resolved. Obviously, PCM needs to keep better records of their laptops they distribute. If anyone else has this issue, be aware that your warranty registration may not be a full year. Will start from day PCM receiver laptop. You will just need to send invoice to Dell and they will adjust warranty date from the date the laptop was shipped to you. Granddaughter says laptop working fine as of today.

Update: 08/11/2023
This registration of laptop for Warranty and ownership with Dell and 3rd party PCM (3rd party shipping) has no idea who this laptop is registered to because they can’t find the order number because they have so many locations they ship from. I bought this for my granddaughter who has already gone to college and loaded all her software. She needs to transfer to her name. If I had known this wasn’t coming straight from Amazon I would have purchased at Brick & Mortar store on Directly from Dell. But I had faith in both Dell and Amazon. PCM keep saying return it and they will ship another one or I can buy one from someone else. It’s unbelievable and ridiculous they don’t have inventory of this purchase. Obviously there is a language barrier between PCM and myself because they don’t “get” that we don’t want to return it because she needs it and their English writing is cryptic. I have sent pictures of everything. Invoice, labels on all the shipping boxes, and the underneath of the laptop and with no success. I have tried to explain she needs this laptop now and would be hardship to return it. Dell, on the other hand can’t (or won’t or don’t know how) to register it without this information from PCM.

In addition to this frustration, it shows on Dell website the Warranty started on Jan 6, 2023 and ends on Jan 7, 2024 and I purchased in July 2023 and it shipped to me on July 21, 2023. So that’s not right either. My granddaughter and I sit down together before she traveled to college and loaded programs and spend 4 hours trying to get this registered through Dell to no avail and I completely get the runaround from PCM. Amazon has promised to take care of this but have had no follow up on this either. Laptop seems to be working great she has told me but if not registered in her name is a problem much less the warranty is not correct and cut short by 6 months. It’s a very troubling situation when I thought I was purchasing a realizable and creditable Dell laptop from Amazon.

So now there’s two issues: 1) Can’t get registered in her name 2) the Warranty is cut short by 6 months and it should be according to Amazon the warranty starts at ship date or delivered date.

We just want resolution and move on. Being in IT for 20 years, I know there has to be better management of their assets and inventory.
———————

Unable to give full & detailed review as only had a few days. Setting up was flawless and nice looking laptop and nice size. I will need to write update on the performance and difficulty registering.

However difficult registering with Dell for Warranty purposes. I bought this laptop for my granddaughter who is entering college in a week. I purchased from Amazon. We tried to register it on the Dell Wesite but it’s not recognizing the Service Tag #. I want the laptop to be in her name. I don’t know at this time who it’s registered to. Myself the purchaser or Amazon the retailer.

We did get it set uo easily with the college’s free student MS Office 365 and she has access to her personal email and school email but we are not sure what to do about the registration.

We contacted Dell and they seemed they weren’t sure either. It may have been a disconnect in our languages though. It seems it sure be an easy fix. Just don’t know how to do it.

I do have another question. I am unable to locate its serial number. The Service Tag # (ST) is on the outside bottom of the laptop but nowhere do find the S/N.

I’m an engineer in pursuit of a GPU equipped laptop to support some tricky algorithms. This one has a good GPU, a ton of memory, AND it still has an impressive battery life.

However, the deal breaker for me was a flaw in design. The track pad is very large. So large that, when typing, my right hand rests on top of the track pad.

Pero si tienen oportunidad de ir por la que tiene la tarjeta 4070 por unos $4000 valdría muchisimo la pena.

Ahora la parte de la memoria ram soldada y no expandible es algo fuerte que tomar en cuenta, al menos yo en juegos como Cyberpunk, league of legends, doom eternal, resident evil 4 remake, puede correr con gráficos muy decentes a buenos fps, ya cada quien verá reviews en youtube.

Mi sugerencia es que si o sí compren un COOLERPAD porque se calienta bastante, y además compre otro ventilador pequeño en Shein para que este detrás de la laptop dándole, así le prolongas la vida al equipo.

Compre otra pantalla con HDMI de 32"" así complemento la pantalla pequeña con la que viene.

Sin duda es una compra riesgosa porque viene de USA, así que considerenlo, por la garantía.
por suerte no me ha pasado nada, y cuando me han dado soporte directamente de windows por algunos drivers que se quedo sin sonido un tiempo, tomaron control remoto de la lap y se los instalaron.

B0C24HV9HQ,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,12 August 2024,Mexico,False,"Compre esta laptop durante prime day por 26k pesos mexicanos, por ese precio es completamente imbatible y nada se le compara, aun con algo mas de precio vale mucho la pena.

Lo mejor:
-El rendimiento, sin ser absolutamente tope de gama en CPU/GPU para el tamaño que tiene es un monstruo, las RTX 4070 normalmente se encuentran en laptops mucho mas grandes y pesadas y tener el mismo rendimiento en formato pequeño es un plus, no creo que sea viable poner componentes mas potentes (y con mucho mas consumo) en un cuerpo tan pequeño, ya es top como esta.

-La versatilidad: esta laptop es muy ligera y pequeña, gracias al tamaño y a la potencia la puedes llevar facilmente en una mochila, pesa poco y cuando este desconectada usar como laptop para productividad o cosas ligeras, conectada para juegos, es todo terreno y tengo entendido que soporta cargadores USB C de unos 90w, aunque no he podido probarlo

-La calidad de construccion: esta laptop es casi completamente aluminio lo cual no es comun en laptop aun mucho mas caras, la calidad de construccion sin llegar a los niveles de macbook esta muy bien, ya podrian aprender otras marcas, que es una verguenza que laptops gamer de mucho mas precio tengan cuerpo mayormente de plastico

-El lector de huella y el teclado: otra cosa que normalmente no hay en laptops gamer (y menos a ese precio) me parece un punto a favor, el teclado sin ser una maravilla es bastante bueno y tiene iluminacion por tecla (no por zona), algo igualmente poco comun en laptops gamer de este precio

-La pantalla: Con miniled, una resolucion muy alta y HDR es una maravilla que ya quisieran laptops mucho mas caras, se ve excelente y llega a niveles casi de un macbook, la mejor pantalla no OLED del mercado, y con G Sync ufff, no podria pedir mas

Lo peor:
Que no se pueda ampliar la RAM: Tal vez sea por el tamaño que no permite slots DDR5 normales, pero la RAM esta soldada Y no es reemplazable, 16gb empiezan a ser normalitos y eso limita mucho la vida util de la laptop de aqui a unos años (y seguramente la descarta completamente patra ciertas tareas que requieran gran cantidad de memoria) una lastima que aqui no se venda la version de 32gb que si haria mucha falta, al menos el SSD SI es reemplazable...

La velocidad del puerto microsd: al principio me emocione al saber que tenia puerto micro sd ya que es facil ampliar la memoria y meter mas juegos y cosas, pero el puerto es bastante lento, me da velocidades de 12mb/s en memorias micro sd buenas de samsung, no me quiero imaginar como seria con memorias mas normales, es un puerto para musica y videos, y aun asi apenas alcanza para eso...

La bateria: sin ser mala esperaba que durara mas por 76w, unas 3 o 4 horas en ofimatica y web dependiendo de los settings que le pongas, una bateria de 80w haria que mejorara algo el tiempo y yo creo que el tamaño/peso seguiria sin ser problema, por supuesto olvidate de jugar algo que no sea 2d en bateria, la laptop no esta hecha para eso (como casi todas las laptop gamer)

El ruido: la laptop hace bastante ruido de ventilador en juegos, y aun en tareas sencillas en el modo rendimiento hace un pequeño siseo que podria resultar molesto, yo me acostumbre pero hay gente que podria encontrarlo muy molesto o insoportable

La salida de video USB C no esta conectada a la GPU: En otras laptops gamer que he tenido con mux switch en modo de solo GPU dedicada puedes conectar un monitor externo y hacer que este monitor este conectado directamente a la GPU para tener mejor rendimiento y activar G Sync/freesync, pues en esta laptop no, usar el modo de solo GPU dedicada DESACTIVA la salida de video por USB C (y te avisa por un mensaje) asi que el G sync solo funciona en la pantalla de laptop , es algo que nunca habia visto en ninguna otra laptop y no se si es por alguna limitacion tecnica, es una decepcion bastante grande para gamers mas hardcore, para el usuario normal no hay tanto problema, tal cual viene se puede conectar a monitores por USB C (o HDMI), pero como usa optimus y el monitor lo controla la dedicada de intel no tendra el maximo rendimiento en juegos (si no entendiste muy bien lo que comente no deberia preocuparte en absoluto)

En resumen es una excelente laptop, tiene caracteristicas muy top que se encuentran en modelos mucho mas caros a precio contenido, yo la compre en oferta pero aun valdria la pena si valiera 32k, aun por ese precio no hay casi nada mejor.

Recomiendo actualizar a la ultima bios de acer desde la pagina web en cuanto la tengan en las manos, las actualizaciones de bios son importantes y especialmente esta ya que mejora el soporte en las ultimas versiones de W11.

B0C24HV9HQ,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,31 March 2025,the United States,False,"During normal usage with power modes set to ""Best power efficiency"" or ""Balanced"" and the fan on ""Quiet"" or ""Balanced,"" the laptop remains extremely quiet. Thanks to its advanced lithography-based chip, energy consumption is remarkably low, with minimal performance impact from reduced voltage. Even after gaming, temperatures remain exceptionally low.

The main drawbacks are the limited port selection and soldered RAM. However, as long as you manage your workload efficiently—avoiding excessive multitasking during intensive tasks—performance remains stable. The lack of ports can be mitigated with a USB dock featuring HDMI and RJ45 Ethernet.

You can pretty much game on high - ultra at 1440p and stay above 60 fps, or if you want more fps, you can lower the resolution at 1080p and get even more fps.

Things I don't like:

- Poor battery life: If you tune the settings, you can get at most 2 hours of battery, and if you like to get more performance on the go, you can probably get 1 hour and 20 mins.

- Gets really hot: when gaming, the aluminum under screen and the center of the keyboard can get so hot that sometimes you can not place your hand or fingers for too long.",0

B0C191GPR7,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,11 April 2025,Germany,False,"das war schon der dritte Laptop, den ich mir bestellt habe. Das erste Gerät war ein Chromebook von Lenovo, ich glaube 3i, da war das Display ganz schlecht, sehr sehr hell und ausgewaschen.
Beim zweiten Lenovo flex 14 Zoll, das ich so gerne behalten hätte, war der Akku kaputt.
Jetzt möchte ich zu diesem noch eine gute Bewertung abgeben, auch wenn ich es letztlich doch zurück sende.
Der Grund für die Rücksendung ist, dass der Laptop nochmal deutlich größer und schwerer ist als mein Gerät von lenovo, auch ein convertible (15,6 Zoll!!), und daher einfach unhandlich ist.
Ich möchte aber auch betonen, dass es überhaupt NICHT an der Qualität oder Kompatibilät liegt, wie es jetzt in einer Anmerkung von amazon steht, dass es deshalb oft zurückgesendet wird.
Wenn man in der Playstore geht und office laden möchte, steht da, dass das nicht funktioniert. Man kann aber sein office über google chrome starten. Ich habe es schon benutzt, und es hat ganz normal wie sonst funktoniert, es war auch ein separates Fenster, nicht nur eine Registerkarte innerhalb des Browsers. Allerdings arbeitet man über die drive, das hatte ich sowieso schon und hat keine lokalen Dateien, d.h., ohne Internet ist es sicher ein Problem.
Was aber wirklich toll ist, ist das Display. Es ist im Gegensatz zu dem anderen Chromebook total intensiv und glänzend, spiegelt allerdings auch ein bisschen.
Die Einrichtung ging fast ganz von selbst, ein google Konto hatte ich schon, alle Apps waren automatisch installiert und die Bedienung von Chrome empfinde ich als sehr komfortabel. Die Tastatur ist schön, ich mag das Gerät.
Es lässt sich auch komplett umklappen, sodass es als Tablet gehen würde. Wie gesagt, ist es aber sehr groß und schwer, daher auch der Abzug. Ich versuche es jetzt mit einem änlichen in 14 Zoll, die sind allerding von lenovo deutlich teurer.

B0BZQPQD63,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,22 September 2024,the United States,False,"I don't have too much to say about it. It runs about as well as my PC at home, if not better.
I've used it to play AAA titles and MMOs in the late evening while on trips out of town, to do work for college, coding & my job. It's a great laptop.

A few things to consider. While the numpad that's build into the touchpad is neat at first... it's just a nuisance when your catch your hand on it while gaming & then you're hitting random buttons on accident. Also, the resolution isn't 16:9, it is 16:10. You're going to have issues getting the full screen to be filled for some games & you're going to lose 1-2 inches of screen to black-bars in games such as Elden Ring.

However, I feel like the 16:10 resolution provides for a more compact laptop shape. I have a 16:9 laptop & it feels so lopsided to use or carry around. This one feels great. Plus you have more vertical space for say, writing a program in VSCode or the like. So it's a bit of a give & take there.

PSA - I'm told ASUS customer service is horrible these days. If you have any issues with your laptop, please be warned you might be best off seeking other routes for repairs. Even if you are in warranty. There's plenty of videos on Youtube about it. Gamers Nexus is the one that alerted me to the potential issue.

Meh: Battery life is abysmal but Optimus helps with that. Also wasn’t expecting this thing to last 8 hours given its primary function and hardware.

Meh: I can’t figure out how to properly wake up the laptop from sleep mode. Sometimes clicking the mouse works, sometimes pressing a key does the trick, and other times I have to press the power button to awaken it.

Unsure: I hear frequent scratchy sounds from the board that almost sound like an old school hard drive on its way to total failure. Google suggests this might be coil whine, but I’m not really sure.

Build quality is good. Even though it is totally made of plastic, it doesn't feel or look cheap. It does pick up fingerprints quite easily though. The blue color is gorgeous!

Keyboard works well. Not a lot of travel to the keys, and it's not backlit, but it works well. Trackpad is plastic and can be temperamental if you have any kind of liquid on your fingers. Lots of useful shortcuts on the keyboard.

Processor, which is the i5-1235u was actually nice. For the price, this machine is dang snappy! Running basic programs is a breeze and some lightweight gaming via Eternium and Legends of Runeterra was smooth and enjoyable.

Built in webcam is nothing special but also not horrible.

Battery life seems average though I must admit this mostly stays attached to the cord in my bedroom. Battery health is still at 98% after almost a year of ownership with it almost constantly plugged in.

SSD is quick and it boots up fast. Was gonna expand the storage and RAM but one of the screws on the bottom casing just does not want to unscrew and might be tightened too much or I ended up stripping it. Not sure which it was.

It's not super lightweight but it's not a behemoth. For the $400 I paid for it, can't really complain.

Oh, but there is one complaint. The screen. Yes it's big and Full HD but unless you have it angled JUST right it can look rather washed out with poor contrast. At that perfect angle it does indeed look great though

The style, elegance, weight and everything is perfect to look at. My excitement at owning what I thought would be a reliable and efficient piece of technology was short-lived, as the issues started cropping up just a couple of days after use. First and foremost, the discovery that the warranty on this laptop was set to expire merely one month after my purchase was utterly shocking. This information was neither disclosed at the point of sale nor clearly indicated in any of the documentation provided. It's bewildering and unacceptable how a product can be sold with such a limited window of warranty support, especially when it's supposed to be brand new. To add insult to injury, the fingerprint ID, a feature I was particularly excited about for its convenience and security benefits, stopped working almost immediately. No amount of troubleshooting or attempts to reset the feature made any difference. This issue significantly undermines the user experience and the security of the device, making it a considerable inconvenience. Overall, my experience with this laptop has been nothing short of a nightmare. I had high hopes and expectations, but the reality has been a series of disappointments and frustrations. To anyone considering this brand or model, I strongly advise looking elsewhere. The apparent lack of quality control, combined with insufficient warranty coverage and poor customer service, makes this a purchase I regret profoundly.",0

The laptop has an average weight. Battery life is good I have been using it for a month now and if i was out of my house probably I would had get like 10-11 hours with two windows open and no music, i think is pretty good. The camara is not bad, but not good as well just average is not a iPhone doing FaceTime but it will get you through the meetings without a problem, didn’t feel any lagging or any issue in a 3 hours meeting. The material outside is good and sturdy. The keyboard has nice buttons I just wish it was the keyboard with light. But i knew that when i bought it. Overall is good. I did take my toefl test with it and their program sucks and to be honest normally affordable laptops don’t run that well programs to heavy. But guess what!! This one did, it run smoothly no crushes i have even played with it. Let me just make it clear. It is not a gamer laptop resolution of the screen is not bad but when it comes to games the processor can’t handle it that well. For the price it works better than what I expected. So if you are looking for a laptop to work or study that can handle your 8 open windows while running music and not crushing at all let me tell you this is a good choice. Also the intel core it has is the best version of the i3 which is better than the i5
Also the memory ram and the ssd both can be upgraded which means a lot!! For those that wants an smoother from 8.5 to 10 /10 you can upgrade both the ram and ssd it would probably get you to the 9.5 out of 10 😊

I am NOT a Windows expert by any means. Prefer Linux.
When I bought this, I didn't realize the complexity of Win 11 over Win 10 !!
So, after I got this, I leaned that MICROSOFT had implanted something, that if the laptop felt it was being ""intruded"" upon, it locked up and you had to find/get the BitLocker ""key"" to re-open the laptop!!!
After, I created a Microsoft account, I was able to get this very long number to get MY laptop back in MY control!!
Then, when I tried to download an app that I wanted, Microsoft didn't like it, & blocked by saying it wasn't in the Microsoft library!!
I then had to contact a Microsoft tech, whom said that my Window version was Mode ""S"", meaning secure/safe.
He had to take control of my laptop, and download a file, in order to be able to turn Mode ""S"" OFF!!
I prefer a Linux OS over dominating Windows any day, but, unfortunately this is how they come.
Win 10 is a bit more relaxed, but Win 11 is horrible, in my opinion, not at all user friendly, except to a professional Geek.
Its a great computer, with the exception of the Microsoft hurdles you may have to overcome.

B0BXRMMNH5,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,18 April 2024,the United States,False,"Quisiera compartir mi experiencia con este producto para ayudar a aquellos que, como yo, se enfrentaron a indecisiones al momento de adquirirlo debido a la escasez de información en español sobre lo que buscaba.

Opté por comprar esta laptop con la intención de utilizarla para tareas de oficina, disfrutar de algunos juegos casuales como Dota 2, y eventualmente editar videos cortos de mi dron DJI mini 3 en Davinci Resolve (aunque aún no he tenido la oportunidad de probarlo).

Antes de realizar esta compra, cabe destacar mi experiencia previa con mi antigua laptop Asus X450CA, equipada con un procesador Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3337U CPU, que ya mostraba signos de fallos.

Tras una exhaustiva investigación de diferentes opciones para encontrar la mejor relación calidad-precio, mis opciones se redujeron a la Asus VivoBook15 F1504ZA (i3 1215u) y la Acer Aspire 3 A315-24P-R7VH (Ryzen 7320U).

Finalmente me decidí por la Asus debido a mi experiencia previa satisfactoria con la marca. Aunque ambas computadoras contaban con solo 128GB de memoria interna SSD, lo cual consideré poco, la Asus ofrecía la posibilidad de expandir tanto la capacidad del SSD como la memoria RAM. Aunque la Acer contaba con memoria DDR5 y la Asus con DDR4, solo esta última permitía la expansión.

A continuación, mencionaré algunos aspectos negativos del producto, que considero justificados dadas las características y el precio económico del equipo: En mi opinión, el principal punto débil de esta laptop es la calidad de la pantalla, que no es muy alta. La duración de la batería es de aproximadamente 4.5 horas con un uso moderado, pero al jugar se reduce a unas 2.5 horas. La tarjeta gráfica es Intel UHD, a diferencia de lo que indican las especificaciones técnicas, que mencionan Intel Iris Xe.

Entre los aspectos positivos, que he podido confirmar en poco tiempo, se encuentran los siguientes: La laptop es muy rápida, el teclado tiene un tacto excelente, la ampliación de la RAM y del SSD es sencilla, el sonido es espléndido, en juegos como Dota 2 alcanza los 80fps o más, tiene un diseño sencillo y elegante, y la mayor parte del tiempo los ventiladores no emiten ruido alguno.

Algunos datos adicionales que pueden resultarte útiles:

Según mi investigación, es posible aumentar la capacidad del SSD a 1TB y la memoria RAM a 16GB.

Basándome en mi experiencia personal, he ampliado el disco duro a 500GB con un SSD Kingston Nvme m.2. PCIe 4.0 (aunque el producto solo soporta PCIe 3.0, acepta la instalación del 4.0, aunque no alcanza su velocidad máxima, solo la permitida por el 3.0). También he aumentado la memoria RAM de 8GB (Memoria RAM soldada) a 16GB con una memoria Kingston SODIMM DDR4 de 3200MHz de 8GB (en el slot libre que ofrece el producto).

Para concluir, un dato que podría ayudar en la decisión de compra de este excelente producto (al menos para mí): En algunos comentarios he visto quejas sobre el equipo que viene con Windows S. Recomiendo no perder tiempo devolviendo el equipo, ya que la gente que puede comentar es solo la que lo ha comprado. En su lugar, buscar un tutorial en Youtube.com sobre cómo cambiar de Windows S a Windows normal, lo cual tomará aproximadamente 30 segundos (ten en cuenta que si se realiza este cambio, no será posible volver a Windows S).

¡Saludos y espero haber sido de ayuda! 😄

It would not stay in the hole. Would come out. Anyhow, I also wanted a ""power"" button on top of my laptop where all the other keys are, instead of on the side (like my Dell has it). Upon days of research, I came across the Acer Aspire 5 and compared it to other laptops and decided to get it. It is the best decision I made for myself! The cost was great. Half the price of my Dell. And it's fast! My Dell was slow. Always buffered during movies and tv shows. I do not know the ""computer lingo"" or jargin to describe the specs on it, but as a lay person who has used computers since the '90's, it loads quickly. And the graphics are clear when you watch a video or a movie. I do a lot of streaming online and have no problems with it. The sound is okay. But I use headphones anyways and it is good. The battery life is fantastic! I can use this for 6 hours on the battery without stressing to plug it in.

Ich habe mich umgesehen in der ""bis zu 2k Euro"" Klasse - und wollte die aktuelle Technik und alles was es momentan so gibt in einem Gerät haben. Es gibt ja nahezu unzählige Angebote mit massiven Abstrichen an diese Ansprüche - aber gar nicht mal so viel billiger als dieser Laptop hier. Mal sind es Prozessoren der 12. oder gar 11. Generation - dann keine 40x Grafikkarten - winzige SSDS usw.
Also warum der hier? Weil er einfach alles hat was zum Stand 15.6.2023 aktuell ist - I7-13700H 6 Pcores , 8 Ecores - 4070 Grafikkarte - 1 TB NVME SSD, Bluetooth 5.2 und Wifi 6. Außerdem ist er auch dazu in der Lage bis zu 3 externe Monitore anzusteuern - über HDMI (2.1) Display Port (Mini - 1.4) oder USB C / Thunderbolt.
Momentan habe ich ihn im Wohnzimmer stehen und nur den Beamer über HDMI angeschlossen um D4 bequem vom Sessel aus mit Gamepad zu zocken - die Sounduntermalung ist natürlich an einem expliziten Heimkinoverstärker (Denon 4x h) mit 5+4.1 Boxen deutlich besser als mit den eingebauten Piepslautsprechern. Noch ein Tipp zur Abschaltung des Laptop Bildschirms wenn man ohnehin über HDMI das Bild ausgibt - einfach Windows-Taste + p drücken und ausschalten - dann hat man nur ein Bild auf dem per HDMI angeschlossenen Gerät - sofern das aktiv ist. Bisher habe ich keine Kritikpunkte gefunden - alles läuft ohne Probleme.

B0BXGYFLP7,Anonyme,2.0,Sans titre,29 January 2024,Germany,False,"The device overall is not the worst. Sadly it is not good either. Lots of crashes happen randomly, seems to be an issue with RAM or a BIOS problem, and there are a lot of other issues with the device's design.

The keyboard overall doesnt feel good. Got fatigued in my fingers after 2 weeks of daily use. I also feel that the touchpad has an oddly sticky surface, making quick swiping during web browsing slower than it should be. The outside of the laptop stains very quickly even with clean hands. Not the same with other laptops. The backlighting also turns off every 30 seconds with no way to keep it on permanently.

The biggest problem though is the Gigabyte Control Center software. It constantly overwrites custom power plans, but does not properly enforce its own efficiency settings, not providing ideal battery life. Further, the software tends to crash, and sometimes glitches out and uses up a ton of CPU while on battery, shortening battery life significantly. This leads to the function shortcuts no longer working right.

The crashes and software issues lead to a lot of unintended reboots during work. There were also crashes while rendering on the GPU despite not reaching anywhere near thermal throttling.

In the end I decided to spend another 300 on top of this price and buy a more high quality laptop from ASUS that delivers roughly 2x the CPU power while not having any of the above issues (but shorter battery life). It was more expensive, but it made all the difference. Can not recommend this laptop.

I needed something that wasn't wafer thin flimsy and that didn't cost an arm and a leg. I am by no means a gamer, nor do I play PC games but I was still looking for a laptop that had some heft to it. I stumbled across this one mainly because it was suggested by amazon and the price seemed right even though its a 2021 model. After reading reviews and comparing bewteen this and the similar price/spec Acer Nitro, I chose this one because upgrading the RAM and adding an additional SSD drive wouldn't require a doctorate in computer science.

As far as upgrades are concerned I also purchased the crucial 64GB (2x32gb) set as well as a 2TB Crucial NVMe SSD drive when I ordered this as mentioned by an earlier reviewer. The install took all of 10 minutes to pop the back cover off and slip in the new RAM/SSD modules and I was ready to fire this baby up. I figured I would just max the RAM (64GB) and beef up the storage and be done with it so opening the back cover wouldn't be necessary any time soon.

Initial setup was pretty straightforward with Windows 11 and once I got to the home screen I got into the settings and performed all the necessary windows updates as well as the updates for the bundled Asus graphics software. Aside from the McAfee antivirus and the Microsoft 365 trial programs, there was no other bloatware to be found. Once those were uninstalled I was able to customize settings to my liking.

The laptop comes as advertised, I wasn't expecting 15 USB ports on this nor do I require that many. The keyboard is very nice and is a full size with a slightly smaller than normal 10 key number pad. Keys are nice and clicky, not mechanical but also not a mushy membrane either. The backlit keys are a nice touch and can be customised to your liking as long as it's all the same color. It has about four different modes for pulsing lights or strobe or just on always. The trackpad is great and has the physical right and left mouse buttons and it is mostly centered so you dont brush the trackpad when typing.
Out of curiousity I tried the online benchmark test to see how this machine ranked, and surprisingly with the RAM upgrade it ranked in the 92 percentile range (see photos) and the graphics were very smooth ranging anywhere from high 60's to 130 FPS on ultra settings.

As mentioned I am not a PC gamer but hopefully this information will be helpful for those that do partake. I may run some console emulators at some point, but for now I'll just be enjoying the soft glow from the keyboard lighting.

Lo que definió mi decisión por este equipo, es su opción modular, puedes ampliar la RAM hasta 64 y tiene 2 ranuras para SSD M2, lo cual ayuda a que se mantenga vigente mucho tiempo.

El único detalle que tiene, que es entendible, es la duración de la batería, si quieres un rendimiento óptimo para juegos debe de estar conectada a la corriente, ya que activa el modo turbo, pero en modo performance puede correr bastante bien 1 o 2 horas.

B0BWH24995,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,8 March 2024,the United States,False,"After several unsuccessful purchases/returns to find a replacement for my broken PC - I have chosen this item (LG 14"" laptop) by the following criteria:
- Gen 7 CPU
- Bluetooth 5 (as Windows 11 has issues with legacy Bluetooth)
- USB-C supporting Thunderbolt 4
- Ability to connect to 2 external monitors
- Compact size, as I am not using internal display
- Hi-Speed USB A to support multiple external HDs.

I know that my requirements could rather be met by 17"" laptop, but this item meets my requirements to complete satisfaction.

First of all - LG website is much more user friendly and had the complete specification information, compare to other providers, where some specifications were missing and that was one of the reasons for returns.

This item recognizes all my Bluetooth devices: mise, keyboards, audio systems.
I am able to use two external monitors in two configurations:
- One monitor via USB-C. Second - as wireless display;
- Both monitors connected to both USB-C ports. In this configuration PC works on the battery, as one of USB-C is used for power supply.
This item has only one USB-3 port, but I use industrial grade USB-3 powered HUB for connecting multiple external HDs. The usual transfer speed which I saw up to now was from tens KB to 100 MB. This item performs data transfer via USB-3 HUB at up to 280 MB. Unbeleavable!
Picture on the external monitor via WiFi - is perfectly stable, compare to picture from my other PCs.
Local navigation and browsing are amazingly fast.
I simultaneously use 2-3 Visual Studios, SQL (SSMS), 5-7 opened Office docs, 3-4 websites.
This item does not produce ANY noise at all.

The ONLY thing that can be considered as ""good to have"" is - power supply comes through USB-C port, so actual use of both USB-C ports can be only on battery.
As a hint: I use USB-C Bi-directional switch, and switch between second monitor to power supply with one button push. I was able to use both monitors for 3 hours with laptop on the battery.
If I need second monitor for a long time - I use wireless connection.

This item is small but really powerful.

B0BWFSY8T2,Richard Freitag,3.0,Good but with missing accessories and a slower SSD compared to the new model,23 April 2023,the United Kingdom,False,"The laptop arrived quickly and properly packed. Unfortunately there are a few things that lead me to give only three stars: lack of USB adaptors, failed Windows recovery, and most significantly a much slower SSD compared to the original XPS 13 Plus (9320).

The laptop came in a generic Dell-branded box as opposed to the original Dell box from the description, only containing a 65W USB-C power supply. The USB-C to 3.5mm and USB-C to USB-A adaptors were not included in the package. The unit itself was in a good shape, the fingerprint-reader/on-button and the Enter-key were slightly uneven. The bottom of the unit came with one screw covered in a ""warranty void if removed sticker"" and one screw was covered in red color, likely nail polish.
Windows 11 was pre-installed with an auto-login. A recovery of the operating system to make sure it is a clean installation failed several times. Installation of Linux succeeded as expected.
The laptop came with an SSD labeled as ""BC711 NVMe SK hynix 1TB"", which is significantly slower than the Western Digital SN810 that reportedly comes with the unit, with the original WD disk being roughly 50% faster than the Hynix disk. The original WD disk is a PCIe Gen4 disk, while the Hynix is PCIe Gen3. S.M.A.R.T. disk status shows it to be a new unit, though.
If you are forced to buy a Windows license, USB-adaptors, as well as a fast SSD, the purchase price will come much closer to the original unrefurbished price of the unit and leave you uncertain regarding the warranty of the unit. If you can live with these limitations, it is a very good deal.

Build: I feel like this computers build is very nice. It is quite thin and light. I like the feel of the keyboard. The machine doesn't run hot which is really a plus.
Layout: ON the right top above the keyboard pannel is the power buttonKeyboard The computer is set to auto power up when you open the lid so if you hit the power button you may turn off the computer. You can change this in Lenovo software.
there are no other buttons above the keyboard.
Power jack is on the top left.
a USB a port, HDMI, USB C port, and headset jack down the left side.
UsB A, and card reader down the right side. The SD card doesn't go all the way in the body of the laptop so you can't leave it in for storage.
Keyboard: f keys are mapped as media keys out of the box. You should go into the Lenovo software to put them back to f keys if you are a screen reader user. This is accessible with both JAWS and narorator.
There is no applications key.
Volume down and up are fn+f2 or f3.
The arrow keys are not in a T shape but you can differinciate them on the keyboard.
Sound/Speakers: Good quality honestly. Better than I expected. No your not going to listen to music out of them, but they are more than fine for a screen reader. Internal microphone is surprisingly good if you disable the processing in the sound settings.
The machine has two drives internal. Your OS and software instals are on a 128 GB, and there is a seperate data drive which is really nice. The data drive comes empty. It is the d: drive out of the box.
The computer is quick plugged into a/c power, files copy quick navigation is quick. It is hardly navigateable on battery out of the box. It was quite shocking. I went into the power settings and cranked the processer up to 100% which helped a little? I then went to run and msconfig and quit a lot of software that I didn't need running. That helped some as well. I then turned off ""Sharky"" on JAWS 2023 which is the hands free assistant. This really quickened things up for me as a screen reader user. Now it is running smoothe. A/C Power is still quicker and if you are sighted you may have access to the bios and be able to make some settings changes there to.

All and all I am happy with the machine. For the money it is amazing. I have a 2 GB SSD and 20 GB ram and that is pretty sweet. I am guessing the processer is where this computer may fall short for some benchmarks.

B0BTZWF5G2,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,19 June 2023,the United States,False,"ASUS TUF is a high-quality, but affordable gaming PC that delivers!

Performance:
I have the i5-12500H variant, and this processor has not shown any slowdowns at all! During the initial setup, and for the first 2 days, it was moving a little sluggish, but the Task Manager showed that it was Windows processes that was using most of the CPU and RAM at the time (happens to all computers from time to time). Outside of that, the performance is flawless. I have used it to play Halo: Master Chief Collection, and it runs like a beauty!

Wi-Fi speeds are immaculate! The Wi-Fi chip performs flawlessly! Not to mention that it is also equipped with an ethernet port as well. No complaints here.

Screen:
Upon first bootup of the desktop (after the setup screen), I IMMEDIATELY saw the quality of the screen. Viewing angles are just about perfect as well! This is my first foray into 144Hz territory, and I love it! Transitions are smooth, and I often move the mouse pointer from one corner to another just to enjoy the frame rate. The screen gets plenty bright for indoor use, and suitable for outdoor use as well. Direct sunlight, however, is a bit of a letdown. At the same time, I don't like or suggest using PCs in direct sunlight if possible, as the heat is not good for the device.

The color accuracy leaves a little to be desired, as it does not provide 100% of the sRGB color gamut (around 46-55%, I think), so be careful with photo processing. The screen has a matte surface, so there are NO reflections to speak of.

Hardware:
That being said, this device is great with high/low temps as well! It doesn't slow down with the cold, and it doesn't throttle when hot. The fans do a great job keeping the laptop cool and preventing throttling, even while gaming. Maybe I should try gaming outside in the sunlight....? Perhaps a future edit is in order.

Back on track, the fans are audible while performing CPU-heavy tasks (gaming and video processing), but completely quiet while using simple processes, like web browsing and document editing. In fact, I thought the fans turned off, but I can feel a very slight breeze from the back of the device at all times. For simple tasks, this is actually just fine to use in your lap. The rear vents prevent overheating when used on your lap as well. I do not suggest using it in your lap while gaming.

The hinge for the screen is sturdy, and the laptop material feels durable and looks good. The keyboard and wrist-rests get smudges, though. Not too fond with that. It is easy to clean with a microfiber cloth, though, so all is not lost.

Now, the not so good (don't worry, the list is short):

Battery:
The battery is easily the greatest letdown for this computer. For everyday tasks, you can get 3-5hrs of battery life, depending on different factors (fan speed, screen brightness, backlit keyboard settings, speaker volume, etc.). However, when gaming, the battery life TANKS! You might get 1:30hrs if you are lucky. For older titles, these metrics change by a lot. But for Halo, for example, I was at 50% in about 40mins. I imagine that video processing would deliver slightly better results, but not aby too much. Keep your plug handy.

Speakers:
The speakers are decent. Bass is non-existent, but I did not expect that. The vocals, however, are rather clear. The speakers do provide a stereo experience, with the left and right channels working as intended (great for shooting games to know the origin of bullets and footsteps). I typically use Bluetooth or external speakers, so I don't have too many complaints about this.

Conclusion:
This laptop is a very solid performer for whatever tasks that you want to do, but be mindful of the battery limitations. Keeping this in mind, you won't regret this purchase!

B0BTQ61Z6D,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,2 December 2023,the United States,False,"My 8-year old Acer Aspire Win10 laptop is still working, but is not capable of running Win11, and since support for Win10 ends next year, time to think of getting a new generation laptop. This new Acer Nitro 17 is a beast, and at a great Black Friday price. With the 17-in. display, RTX 4060 GPU , Ryzen 7 7840HS CPU, and 1TB SSD HD, this would be a really decent gaming laptop. I don't game, but this thing will be capable of equally-demanding video editing/transcoding or 3D modeling/engineering/design apps. This laptop also comes in a variation using an Intel i7 CPU for about the same price, which made for a tough choice since both models of CPU are similar in performance. I ultimately went with this AMD processor because of slightly faster RAM speed and slightly lower power consumption, so hopefully it will run a little cooler as well. (But frankly, either CPU would be good). This laptop boots up quick and runs like a champ, with a clear, sharp, and bright BIG-screen display (which also means a full size keyboard underneath). I'm thrilled with its performance; every app I've previously used is much faster on this machine. The jury is still out on Win11, but I guess that's something I'll get used to. The only upgrade I'm considering is doubling the RAM from 16 to 32 GB, and possibly a 2TB SSD if I ever get close to filling up the 1TB model already installed. This is a GREAT large-screen laptop at a good price, especially if you can catch it on a price dip like Black Friday. I'm a big fan of Acer, and this laptop is highly recommended!

EDIT:
After 2 months, decided to double the RAM to 32GB after noticing Windows 11 utilized over 25% of total RAM capacity even when running at idle, not leaving much excess for really intensive apps or heavy multi-tasking. OEM RAM was (2x8GB) DDR5 5600CL46 by Hynix, a well-regarded brand.... YES, 5600MHz memory speed as opposed to the slower 4800MHz speed shown in some listing specs, which is a nice bonus. Several good brands to choose from for the RAM upgrade (Corsair, Crucial, Hynix, Patriot, Gskill, etc.), but one stood out. Kingston Fury Impact 5600CL40 SODIMM's not only run at 5600MHz speed, but also have better latency (CL40, as opposed to CL46 for the other brands). Price was reasonable as well (in fact, cheaper than most of the others; and co-incidentally, using chips made by OEM manufacturer Hynix), so I definitely recommend Kingston Fury Impact RAM as an excellent upgrade for this AMD-based Nitro laptop. CPU-Z utility shows the new RAM working fine at 5600 MHz speed and CL40 latency rating. (see attached photos for before-and-after CPU-Z displays of RAM memory, 32GB new vs. 16GB old). Now when laptop is running at idle, Windows 11 only uses about 12% of RAM, leaving much more for app-related purposes, so everything should run more smoothly and quickly, even when multi-tasking. This motherboard is capable of handling up to 64GB of total RAM, but from what I've read that much is overkill - an unnecessary expense and excessive RAM that will never get fully utilized. 32GB of RAM seems to be the sweet spot for maximum efficiency in this system. Makes this fantastic laptop even better than before!

The 165hz with 3ms on a monitor is something no gamer should be without, it changes your game and will make you unstoppable. This laptop definitely delivers this. With QHD your game will change forever.

The RTX 4060 is a major asset to any gamer that wants to utilize the high refresh rate monitors with a game that delivers high detail games. Only downside as with most other laptops but so far I’ve ran into no excessive heat, however the fans are very loud.

The CPU in this laptop isn’t quite bare minimal; it’s more than enough to not bottleneck your PC specs from the CPU alone but running too many programs will make the CPU get a little hot thus the laptop gets much louder.

To be honest, my old real beef with this beast is the 16gb ram it comes with. It’s really the only problem I run into. If I want to run a high memory game and an internet browser then that is really not possible without overloading your ram. I’m sure you can replace the ram, just check warranty information and make sure you find a way that doesn’t void your warranty.

This laptop is also very heavy, which is to be expected from how heavy GPU’s are becoming these days.

B0BT3CD75G,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 January 2025,the United States,False,"Pros:
Decent battery life
Easy to upgrade. Just unscrew the bottom screws pop open the bottom lid (but be careful not to break the side ports and internal components obviously) and wala! You have access to the ssd ram and a spot for a 2.5” ssd or hdd. M.2 ssd and ram are fully upgradable. Ram goes up to 64gb max so you can do a lot with that
It has usb 3.1 and usb c
It’s fairly low power and lightweight too
The onboard gpu isn’t too bad but the RTX 4050 is pretty good for what I use too. Both gpus perform well in Daz Studio Marvelous Designer and Blender
I’m not a gamer but I do play GameCube Wii Gameboy and DS emulators and occasionally simcity 5 and a TON of simcity 4. On simcity 5 the most graphics intensive game i play I can crank the settings up to maximum using the RTX and it plays very smoothly and looks great as well.
WiFi is wifi 6 so not too bad either but I use Ethernet so that doesn’t matter to me really all that much
CPU is a 10 core 12th gen i7 with upper 4.ghz range boost clock so cpu rendering in blender and Daz is fairly painless. It’s not gpu rendering but still very good—definitely good enough for me and I make big complex scenes with lots of lights characters VDBs special effects and other intricate stuff also I do short animation clips as well so let that be your gauge.

Cons: more like nitpicking—because ya know we ALL have nitpicks about everything

It’s not 2.5gb Ethernet
It has red led keyboard not RGB
It too lightweight for me but that’s probably because all the previous laptops I owned were giant bricks of gaming laptops from the mid 2000s back when everyone used first generation i7s (or back then the ONLY generation i7s) you should have seen the dinosaur dell gaming laptop I had before this. Oomph! My back (and wallet) hurts just thinking about that old laptop I had before I bought this one. This is by far a massive upgrade and improvement!

It’s ddr4 not ddr5 which is really not the worst thing for me as my gpu rendering workstation desktop pc runs a Maxwell gpus and 2666ghz ddr4 ram and it’s pretty good at gpu rendering.
The RTX dedicated gpu is only 6gb vram but really for me I use it primarily for CPU rendering anyway and barely ever use the RTX on it except for computations in my rendering software and every once in a while my emulators and simcity 5 for which the RTX 6gb is plenty of VRAM for me

This laptop is definitely worth getting if you’re looking for a really good entry level gaming enulator gaming or CPU based 3d graphics modeling and rendering laptop

Pros: Huuuge screen, you can perfectly watch a movie or videos here and in good quality. The screen is not perfect but for this price it is awesome.

- Battery: I've been using it for a couple of hours now with the full charge and so far with medium brightness settings it has consumed around 40% and I've been watching videos, browsing internet etc. OH btw it only took 1 hour or maybe less to fully charge it.

- Numeric keyboard babyyy! Huge screen and great keyboard, keep in mind it's not backlighted so better look for a place with enough light to use it.

- ChromeOS: This OS is packed with more than enough apps and features for a person who simply enjoys scrolling through the internet, read emails, check the weather and of course multimedia. If you're coming from Windows, don't give up on it trust me it is an awesome OS and you have embedded options such as Google Workspace and GDrive to carrry around your files not just on the laptop but on your cellphone, regardless of your phone OS (Android - iPhone)

----------------------------

Cons:

This processor is a basic option to browse the web and basic stuff, heavy Android apps will probably experience lag, so beware that heavy apps may affect performance on the system. If you're planning on downloading games or something like that, maybe this is not your option.

Screen isn't the best, some colors can look washed out... Remember you get what you paid for, if you want a better screen then you will probably have to spend a little more.

Be sure to turn off all the sleep & hibernate crud. Mine would not turn on from a sleep cycle, had to do some trickery to get it to boot up. The power cord to laptop is too tiny, so be careful with it. That same connector you really need to push in until you feel the snap-in, otherwise it will not make contact.

B0BS1H5L4R,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,20 July 2023,the United States,False,"UPDATE: Item purchased 7/20/2023 item does not power on as of 10/3/2023.

I ordered the Lenovo 2022 IdeaPad Gaming 3 15.6"" FHD 120Hz Gaming Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 6600H, 64GB RAM, 2TB PCIe SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050, Backlit Keyboard, Onyx Gray, Windows 11, 32GB SnowBell USB Card.

This review is after using the computer less than 24 hours. If anything changes, I will update my review.

1) I cannot believe how fast this computer shipped. I ordered it on Tuesday a little after 12pm. It was delivered the next day before a full 24 hours passed.

2) I bought this laptop so I can create and edit video using Adobe PremierePro and AfterEffects when I am not at my home office or work office. See my video for how fast this computer opens my Adobe software. I did not open Photoshop because I was working on a file at the time of the video, but it opens in similar time and runs very fast. I am also addicted to Blizzard’s Diablo video games (every version) and Diablo IV looks stunning and plays exquisitely. Everything is running very smoothly, including Diablo IV. You WILL have to update your NVIDIA drivers in order to use the Adobe software listed above, but that is to be expected and does not take long.

3) It was easy and relatively fast to set-up. I hate all the updates and restarts but that’s Windows for you.

4) I bought this laptop because of the price and the power. I have been pricing out laptops for about 3 months and similar laptops cost about double (and higher) the price I paid for this ($1,021.34).

5) I saw other reviewers say it is loud when the fans go on. The fans seem to have multiple speeds. Sometimes they come on and are relatively quiet. Other times.... they sound like a jet taxiing down the runway. I should mention I was dealing with high-detail video when they sounded like a jet engine.

6) The only downside is the battery life. There is no way you will use this computer without plugging it in for 8 hours. In fact I do not think you will get 4 hours out of it. That doesn’t matter to me too much at this moment, just be aware of it. UPDATE AFTER 48 HOURS OF USE: When playing Diablo IV, the battery lasts about an hour. When using the laptop without playing a game or creating video it lasts longer, but is still not great. I have 40% battery life left and the laptop has been on for 2.5 hours. I am still not taking a star off for this as battery life isn't a deal breaker for me.

7) The 32GB SnowBell USB Card was not included. Where's my card man?? I am kidding. I don't care that the card wasn't included. There zero wchance I would have used it and I don't know anyone who would want it so it would have been a total waste to send it. I am only mentioning it here because the description included it and it was not included. No stars lost on this one. In fact, if I could add a star for it not being included, I would.

8) The keyboard is a little touchy. Sometimes it will add an extra space while typing. I have had other Lenovo gaming laptops and it was the same with them. No stars were taken for that because I am used to it.

9) I was able to justify buying this because the graphics card coupled with the processor, ram, and amount of hard drive space will make rendering my videos after I make them a lot faster than my home office and work office desktop computers.

I recommend this computer. I was in no way disappointed.

UPDATE: 7/28/23
I finally made my first video on it. It's a 5 minute long video. It took less than a minute to render and less than 7 minutes to save. I am blown away. Both at work and at my home office it takes those computers HOURS and HOURS to render. I cannot recommend this computer enough.

UPDATE: 8/18/23
I saw other reviews which were negative. I am not sure which laptop they bought but mine absolutely has a webcam. It has a sticker covering the webcam - I chose to keep it on after temporarily removing it to determine webcam functionality. It works. I don't use this for Zoom, Teams etc.
I am still in love with this laptop. Yes, Windows kept updating and it would shut down and start up again and that is frustrating when it happens, but that is a Windows deal. I believe it is up-to-date now because it no longer does the sneak attack updates and restarts.

B0BS1H5L4R,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,3 August 2023,the United States,False,So far I'm impressed with the speed and there isn't a lot of pre-installed bloated software on it. Shipping was very quick and delivered a day earlier than first stated. I'm using it mostly to have overhead for Cisco virtual labs and GNS3 labs requiring a lot of RAM but like that I may be able to run some games even though I rarely play.,0
B0BS1H5L4R,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,27 March 2023,the United States,False,"I've had this for a month now and can say it's been very good, i downloaded the witcher 3 on high settings to see how it would run, and surprisingly it ran pretty well didn't see much frame drop. the only thing i can say is that your probably going to need some external way to cool the laptop, as it does get fairly hot and a bit loud when gaming on higher settings.

and the battery doesn't last very long playing video games, if the charger that came with it was another foot longer it would have been fine for me as i don't have anywhere to put my laptop closer to the outlet. anyways outside of these problems i haven't had any issues and can say that it runs very well. although i do have 32gb stick? or something like that, it doesn't have any anything on it to stick into the usb port of the laptop.

tldr: overall a very good laptop that has fairly impressive optimization mostly hampered by the battery and cooling system, which could be mitigated by having a longer charging cord and adding a cooling pad or external cooling system to it.

update: I'm not sure what they did to this but it's been running really bad lately, I've been trying to get into the bios settings to check if overclock is enabled. however every time i try and enter the bios it freezes up.

this initially ran well for me since i bought it however it's now having a ton of issues. including certain programs made for AMD not working on here anymore. don't buy this unless they address what these issues are

B0BS1H5L4R,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,2 February 2024,the United States,False,The upgrades the seller did to these laptops makes them crash outside of their 30 day return policy! One was within 2 months (we were able to get an Amazon A-Z guarantee refund so not out anything on that one) and the 2nd laptop we bought crashed in less than 6 months. Lenovo warranty won't cover because of upgraded components and specifically said the upgraded components made it crash (that was on the first laptop that we were able to return and get refunded). The second laptop Lenovo said it was already outside of the 1 year warranty when we bought it less than 6 months ago. We hired a third party to try and fix it without any back story and he said the exact same thing - upgraded components made it crash. So we spent $500 for third party to look at it plus the $200 we had to pay to have original parts put back in. So we spent almost $2000 for a laptop you can buy for $500-600 when you consider its basic components that it now is. Seller should be banned from upgrades because they are scamming people!!!

B0BQX4WPFX,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,16 February 2023,the United States,False,"Purchased primarily as a work laptop with the option for streaming games during downtime between classes. (I teach and drive around between locations)

Pros:
Sturdy, stylish, and the garaged stylus is convenient. The 144hz display is perhaps overkill and likely accounts for a fair bit of the price tag that I'd personally prefer to have seen invested in all-aluminum construction or a better webcam.

Chrome OS is a solid platform for general purpose productivity. The hardware is more than sufficient to keep the experience smooth and snappy. The garaged stylus is automatically charged, which is a major improvement over my previous experience of having to recharge my old bamboo stylus every time I wanted to use it because I couldn't be bothered to remember charging it.

The core gimmick of the thing is cloud gaming, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it's a perfectly pleasant experience. The libraries on these services (Amazon Luna, GForce Now) are limited, but growing. I find the niche they occupy to be providing a solid casual gaming experience on the road, rather than being a serious competitor for a desktop gaming PC. I could see that assessment changing very rapidly if their libraries grow to rival steam.

Build quality is solid. The plastic components are finished in a grippy texture and are sturdy enough to feel like it earns the premium price point. Would prefer an all-aluminum construction.

Indifferent:
Audio is great (for a laptop), but that's kind of a moot point for me. I'd consider it poor form to use anything but headphones in a public space, and I've got a desktop for home use.

Cons:
There's a weird bump on the ""d"" key that annoys me constantly despite being of precisely zero consequence. Probably a minor manufacturing defect.

B0BQX4WPFX,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,25 January 2023,the United States,False,"This is a very good looking Chromebook. The build, while on the heavy side, feels very premium and well manufactured.

ChromeOS seems to run quite well and blew away my older chromebook in benchmarks.

The keyboard feels amazing, but is the annoying light gray that ASUS likes to use that can make the keyboard almost impossible to read with backlight on and in certain lighting conditions. It's easy enough to toggle that on or off, and with this being a ""gamer"" keyboard, some of the other colors that you can select were not as bad as white, but with the black text on the gray keycaps it's just not as easy to read as white text on keycaps.

The reason I'm returning the Chromebook is because I experienced audio issues throughout the few weeks that I've had it. The device just wouldn't output audio until restarted. ChromeOS is fully up-to-date and it also reported all firmware was current. The audio issues happened on-device and also while casting to a TV. In each instance, restarting resolved it and the audio worked as expected.

If this wasn't a premium priced Chromebook, I might have lived with that annoyance, but at this price point, I'd expect the basics to work without issue.

There's a chance I had a bad unit, or that it will get fixed eventually with software, but at this time, and at this price point, that wasn't something I wanted to risk on waiting for with the return window closing.

After about a month of owning it, the computer's display stopped working. The fans would turn on, the keyboard would light up, but the display would not turn on. So I sent it in for repairs. I get it back after about three weeks. It seems fine and dandy.

And then it breaks again!

In the exact same way!

I'm not sure what grift Lenovo is running. I'm not sure if they sent me back faulty parts, or if there's something else wrong with it that could have the same symptoms as before, but as a consumer that almost doesn't matter. This shouldn't have happened once, let alone TWICE. Now I have to send it back in for repairs a second time and wait another month to get it back. Who knows how long it will last this time? It might even work for a few weeks before breaking again!

And I missed Amazon's return window, so I won't be getting my money back either. Don't make the same mistake I did. If the screen stops working, just return it because by the time you actually get your computer back, the return window will have closed, and you'll still have a computer with faulty hardware.

B0BPTJ1ST7,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,6 February 2024,the United States,False,"I hate leaving bad reviews, but because of the way Amazon is set up there isn't really a way to contact the seller

The battery only lasts for about an hour - I was expecting it to be at least three hours. It's not long enough to make it through a single college class, which is unfortunate because that's what I bought it for.

The screen doesn't seem to have any anti-glare measures implemented. Complicating the issue, the screen has extremely low-contrast. I have to turn on windows' high-contrast mode in order to even use it, and even with that enabled text is extremely hard to read.

This is a refurbished / modified device. When it arrived, it was already a year past the manufacturer's warranty. This means that I'm left with no recourse - and even if it was within the manufacturer's warranty window, I don't know how that'd square with the fact that the device was modified by a third-party.

If I had known it wasn't covered by the manufacturer warranty, I would have reconsidered the purchase.",0

However after 7 to 8 month screen started flickering its very constant. Sometimes happen just after turning on and flickering stays up to 10 to 15 minutes.
And sometimes happen for more than 30 to 40 minutes while using laptop on battery or without battery for like 1hr.
I have raised to lenovo service center, as per them this product is not from UAE. It is from outside.
So they requested me to call back Amazon customer care and try to connect with the reseller who has listed this product online
Trust me, it’s in hassle for me to chase and get the repair done but still, I am in the middle of something which is unknown

I raised this issue on 3rd June, on 15th June amazon team has refunded back my amount. Would highly appreciate there service who not only understand my query but also helped in with consistent follow up.

Dont by this laptop two main reason
1) This laptop is originated from KENYA
2) Warranty is applicable to KENYA region only.
3) Screen flickring issue will definatly come, i dont how much other customer are not getting..
UAE Lenovo team might charge you it you cant to repair this.
So, be wise and save you money.

That was a pain - lots of time on the phone with two different support groups. After all of that, Acer told me that since the laptop was upgraded after being shipped from the factory (I suppose by Amazon's vendors), the warranty would not cover the upgraded hard drive or the added RAM.

-literally at least 1 minute minimum to bring up any app.

Had to uninstall and reinstall drivers and got it working but I shouldn’t have to do this with a brand new laptop.

Thought that was the end of it but not long after it made me reinstall Windows. What a pain. But what finally did me in was the other day when the audio again stopped working. Tried everything and nothing worked. The next day it suddenly worked again but I was done with this useless and unreliable craptop. So today I went to log out of everything and save some files and you guessed it, Windows has to reinstall. I’m on attempt 6 now. I hate this thing. Even when it worked, it was beyond slow too.

This laptop seemed like a good quality, but it quickly encountered multiple issues.

It spent 3-4 months at Asus support, fixing the wireless adapter, screen, overheating problems, loose pieces left inside the laptop after getting it back from support, etc. Asus extended the warranty by 1 month as a courtesy, but not the 3-4 months where we didn't have the laptop in our possession.

It seemed that we were past all of the major issues. Then, it just up and died. No warning, no sounds, just shutoff/blackscreen. Cannot get it to boot/post, even attempting common support fixes.

Now we have a $1600 paperweight that Asus is not willing to look at again. Shame on you Asus for this abysmal quality, as well as the awful support process.

B0BDP9NTRT,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,23 June 2023,Canada,False,"The product didn't inform me about what S Mode was. S Mode is a very restricted ""walled garden"" mode that microsoft was provided, to force people to use the microsoft store for every single download. On some computers that offer this, you can switch out of S Mode very easily, but for others, it's completely impossible. Therefore, it's appears to be a complete RISK as to what you'll be dealt when you buy a PC pre-installed with S Mode.
Does this sound nuts to you? Don't buy this product. Don't even touch anything pre-installed with Windows S Mode.

On the lenovo laptop in particular, I never found any way of switching out S Mode. In particular, there was no ""Updates and Security"" option in the settings where there was an ""Activate"" link to go to MS Store and access ""Switch out of S Mode"" - which is the suggested method of switching out.
Additionally, because it wasn't able to log into my microsoft account for some reason, I wasn't able to open the store at all, and the settings button became inert altogether. Very weird.

Anyway, I guess I'll have to return this product. I always already weary of Lenovo when I heard about the ""Super Phish"" fiasco years back, so this is perhaps another thing for anyone reading to take note of.

Addendum: Screen Quality, Battery Life, and Weight are all benchmarks that hardware companies find an easy time to match up to, as it's a simple matter of product testing a very small check list and doing all the same stuff the other big companies are doing (trade secrets notwithstanding). I often find that it's the stuff that comes after, that truly matters.

I must retract the my review below and give this laptop one star for serious inconvenience. Shortly after my daughter started school she advised certain keys would intermittently stop working. I remotely accessed her computer and tried many things to resolve the issue. I was on vacation a few hundred miles away when she advised the problem got worse, so I drove to her school and confirmed the issue in person. I bought my daughter a Lenovo laptop from a local Best Buy and took the defective Acer laptop to try and get warranty support. I will update my review once I see how it goes trying to get the laptop fixed.

Original Review

I bought this for my daughter just before she left for college. I really liked the CPU, RAM, storage, and build quality. The laptop feels solid with no easy screen wobble. As with any non-custom built computer, it came with bloatware. The Norton bloatware was almost impossible to uninstall due to an interface resolution issue (I was not able to select the uninstall button since it was out of view). I ended up downloading a Norton removal tool from the Norton website. I removed the remainder of the Windows 11 bloatware that Microsoft now includes and the laptop was running quickly with no unusual lag. My only regret was not buying for myself during the Prime Day sale since it was an incredible deal.

B0BCD2YGM5,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,11 January 2025,the United States,False,"I bought this direct from Amazon.com, but there seems to be some variation in the seller of the product. In my case, the computer came in new condition and has worked great so far. However, it was pre-loaded with a 3 year old version of Windows 11, which kept creating errors as it tried to update to the latest version. The hard drive was also partitioned with about 1/3 of the drive capacity on a C:/ drive and the remaining 2/3 on a D:/ drive. I'm not sure why it was set up that way.

I needed to re-install the latest version of Windows 11 (which is easy to download from Microsoft) to combine the partitions. But, the computer's BIOS was set to view the hard drive as ""RAID"" instead of ""ACHI"", which meant that the Windows installer didn't ""see"" the hard drive. Once, I made the switch in the BIOS to ACHI, then the Windows installer recognized the drive and I could delete all of the partitions, and I now have a single 2TB partition with the latest version of Windows 11.

One other minor problem was that the ""clean install"" of Windows 11 didn't include the Wi-Fi drivers, so I initially needed to connect the computer to my router with an ethernet cable to get it to download that driver and other updates (which Windows Update did automatically).

I'm happy with the product overall...it's difficult to find a computer with this much memory and hard drive capacity without spending 1000s of dollars. But, there were some unexpected complications with how the computer was configured. I wouldn't recommend it for people who don't feel comfortable with (or know someone who is comfortable with) the process above.

Dieser Laptop erfüllt all diese Bedingungen ausnahmslos! Er ist schnell und kann Office Aufgaben ohne Probleme und irgendwelche Hänger bewältigen.

Ich habe auch mal zum Spaß ein paar Gaming Tests gemacht. Klar, dieser Laptop ist für sowas nicht ausgelegt, aber ich konnte dennoch kleinere Spiele wie Minecraft Java z.B. in spielbaren FPS raten spielen (um die 80 - 100 FPS bei FHD, OptiFine mit Standarteinstellungen).

Das Gehäuse fühlt sich (zumindest für mich) sehr hochwertig an und auf der Tastatur lässt es sich auch gut Tippen. Am Touchpad habe ich auch nichts zu bemängeln und durch die Multi-Touch-Gestenunterstützung kann man auch Unterwegs prima mit diesem Laptop Arbeiten

Was ich zu bemängeln hätte ist das die Produktbilder leider in einer kleinen Sache nicht mit dem Produkt was ich als Kunde bekam nicht übereinstimmte. Auf der Leertaste des Produktbilds ist ein Zeichen abgebildet, was bedeutet dass dieser Laptop eine Beleuchtete Tastatur haben sollte, aber der Laptop den ich bekam hatte keine.
Zudem wurde mir dieser Laptop mit Englischem Tastatur Layout und einem Britischen Ladestecker ausgeliefert (Adapter für den EU-Stecker war im Lieferumfang mit dabei). Das mit der Tastatur stört mich nicht so sehr das ich schon aus dem Kopf weis wo sich auf dem Deutschen Layout welche Sonderzeichen und das Ä Ö und Ü befinden, aber für andere Leute die das nicht wissen könnte das Problematisch sein.

Nun denn, im großen und Ganzen ist der Laptop ein perfekter Begleiter für jemanden in der Arbeitswelt und definitiv empfehlenswert 👍🏻

B0B7WNPHSK,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,5 March 2023,the United States,False,"After ten years I needed an upgrade to handle some stats software for some classes I am taking. That aspect is fine, no capacity or processing problems. I don't use this to watch movies or play games, but with those caveats the graphics are fine with inside light. Definitely difficult to see the screen in natural light. The speakers/mic are good, I can do remote meetings, listen to lectures etc. without headphones. The only thing that affects how I wanted to use this is the battery life. It's advertised as eight and commercial reviewers clocked mostly around five hours but after three hours of having Rstudio, being logged into Blackboard and having a browser open to look stuff up on help sites, I need to plug in. It's about four hours for something like having a Word document and using the online library/google scholar for a paper. I had been hoping to have some flexibility in location when doing my school-work (to avoid the kiddos) and this issue torpedoed that idea. I'm old, so I feel a bit petty complaining about having a machine with the capability of any on the market today while not having to be at a desktop in a computer lab. Plus I know I didn't pay as much as I could, so I'm trying to focus on what I got relative to what I didn't, but I do feel a bit misled.

update: horrible battery/power issue. The battery stopped holding a charge, I scrambled to back up what I had to back up before it was all gone. I took it to a repair place, per them the extremely narrow charger meant that the charging pins touched the inside in some way it shouldn't have leading to a power surge which fried the motherboard. This male side of the charger connection is maybe two millimeters, so I see what they mean. Per them this is a really unusual design choice known to cause this issue.

Update again: After the mother board replacement I was fine for a week or so, then this thing wouldn't turn on again. I'm thinking its the same issue so I'm packing up to take it back to the shop and I notice the bottom is burning hot. I had it sitting on a table so I guess the fan could not blow off enough heat. once it cooled everything was working again, but come on. That is a problem I had in the early 2000's. I'm the purchase plus repair price in the hole on this so I am going to see if I can make this work for a couple more years (with frequent cloud backups) but if you have not already made the mistake of buying this, don't. I'm very disappointed, this is my 3rd acer across 20ish yrs, my last one lasted 10 years! This is just crap.

update again: down to one star. overheating issue got worse. that computer is bricked, no response, will count myself lucky if I get the data off it . I have to buy a new computer.

when i powered this on, the laptop turned on for 3 seconds and shutdown.
imagine this feeling after spending about 1500$ and getting broken product.
i contacted the seller, he said to contact amazon.
amazon didnt know to solve this issue so they told me that i can return it back.
amazon didnt provide pickup delivery, i needed to return it myself from my own money and time, it costed me about 100$
amazon returned me just 20$ for the delivery
i needed to wait 3 weeks until amazon will get the return with anxity that maybe it will be lost on the way
one more week to process the refund

I run MS office and a very large research program with a database of just under 100 gb. The fan is effective but very quiet. I use this in a quiet home. I can feel a significant amount of air coming out under load but I can’t hear the fan. I’ve seen one or two comments about the WiFi but I haven’t found any issues. I have cable internet (average 340 download) and I was able to download about 260 gb (files from OneDrive and a research database from another organization) in about four hours over WiFi. Other devices on the network worked well while doing this download (it didn’t bring the network to a crawl like my MacBook does on large downloads).

This is the 2022 model but Lenovo only recently started shipping the 2023 models. This is a very well equipped Thinkpad at an unbeatable price. I’m very happy with the purchase.

B0B443GX48,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,25 September 2022,the United States,False,"So I debated for months about what laptop to get to replace my trusty surface book 2. I simply could not find something that hit all the points that it had but I narrowed my search down to the razer 17 (4k 3080ti), the MSI z17 (3080ti), and the Gigabyte AERO 17 (3080ti). The MSI and Gigabyte had the downside of only being 90w and 105w gpus respectively. The MSI brought touch screen that I desperately wanted but lost out because it only ran at 1440p and I did not want to step down in resolution. So that left the Gigabyte in the running and it is significantly less expensive but lost out because they dropped all the ports off the laptop like some fruity company I know of. So we had the winner of the Razer from the selection. I also knew that I would be upgrading the unit right out of the gate as the storage and ram would need to be bumped up to better cover my software needs. So I booted the laptop to make sure that everything was working and then popped the cover off to swap the ram for a 64GB kit from Kingston (KF548S38IBK2-64) and a 4TB ssd from sabrent. The cover had a bit of a learning curve as you needed to slide it to the front of the laptop to get it to lift off but otherwise was easy to get into. I was disappointed to find a tamper seal on the boot ssd but it did not say warranty void so I will not dock it too hard here. I had some difficulty with the OS clone so I did a clean install from the recovery media from razers webpage (only accessible after you register the laptop). Everything came up and worked no problems when working from the recovery media (I do not recommend a truly clean windows install as there is no page to pull razers software and drivers from). The laptop is a joy to work with as it has tons of power ontap and after the upgrades the ability to replace my desktop in a pinch.

CPU

The new i9 cores are shockingly fast and chew through both lightly and heavily threaded workloads and under the right conditions outpace my old 1950x threadripper. An older cpu to be sure but it still blows my mind that a laptop could keep pace with a hedt processor.

GPU

Where this laptop really sets itself apart is in the gpu department where its higher power limit lets it stretch its legs pushing some titles in 4k at decent settings. I have also given it a shake at 8k but found that the vram buffer is on the very edge of working even in older titles. An example would be skyrim working at stock maxed settings but running out of memory once I enabled an enb.

Thermals/Noise

Experiments aside the laptop will get very loud if you select anything other then the quiet mode. The laptop keeps thermals under control though so I can't knock it much here.

Battery

Expect to be married to the power cord for almost any task as the system sucks down power at an alarming rate. I think some of this is a combo of the high refresh rate screen and the fact that the dedicated gpu is not really disabled in optimus mode but just in a low power state. Do note that the power brick gets quite warm under normal loads and downright hot under stress loads. I strongly recommend keeping it well ventilated and off cloth surfaces.

Screen

The screen was a pleasant surprise for me as it was brighter than the reviews I read lead me to believe. Note it is not a photon cannon but it meets or exceeds the outgoing surface book 2. One thing that I wish it had here was an HDR rated panel. I would give up the high refresh rate for that in a heartbeat but I know that I am in the minority here. Colors are good and I feel that I can edit content on it without having to worry about being terribly inaccurate.

Keyboard

I have to give this a meh rating as it is just so so at best. The keys are mushy and the layout is somehow off a bit for me. I am guessing that I will get used to it but off the bat I find I am getting more errors than normal when typing. The chroma colors are fantastic though and I was able to setup a matching color scheme to my desktop. The colors are bright and vivid so A+ there.

Trackpad

This one surprised me as everyone raves about this track pad but I found the surface book despite its smaller size was better. It has a wedge click that misses my input frequently and its palm rejection is mediocre as I frequently would have the cursor move while I was trying to type.

Port selection

This was a selling point for me and it does not disappoint. The usb A ports are plentiful and the thunderbolt ports are fast. The 2.5G Ethernet is a nice touch though I can't test this as my network is 1G or 10G with no ability to run the interim steps (I will update this if I get a different switch.). The HDMI is 2.1 so you get the full bandwidth to run all the way up to 8k 60hz. Wifi runs the new 6e standard and with a supported network pulls nearly gigabit speeds. Finally the sd card slot is on point reading at my cards rated speeds.

Build quality

Exceptional fit and finish here. Everything is sturdy and I was not found wanting here coming from the exceptional surface book.

Final thoughts

I love this laptop for everything it is capable of doing. It is not a true workstation replacement but no laptop will be able to reach hedt levels. Where this laptop shines is in that space in-between where I can't haul my workstation but still need to edit a video or stitch some images together. I can render a h265 video without proxies on this and with the ram upgrade I can stitch raw files together with confidence. Also it can game and game well but don't expect miracles here as while it has the 3080ti name it is still a notebook gpu so it struggles at 4k in newer titles. The deep vram buffer is a massive boon for work but don't expect to make much use of it in games. If you are looking for a gaming laptop I would look at the 1440p units as it is a more obtainable resolution. For the ""creative"" that games on occasion I think you will be hard pressed to find a better laptop that combines all of these specs in this form factor.

However, the laptop runs hot like my previous HP envy did, and while I don't game everyday to truly wear out the system I think it should last another 4yrs. I'll update my review if anything changes, but so far it's able to run palworld max settings at 60fps, and higher with DLSS or reduced shadows. Note, if you have one of these you're going to want it at an incline for more air, temps dropped by about 10c when I did so. You also don't want to put the power brick on the carpet as it got super hot to the touch when I did so, I'm assuming that's why some other reviews claimed their brick broke.",0
B0B443GX48,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,16 April 2024,the United States,False,"I previously owned the Razer Blade 14 and was sad when I had to part with it at the time.

I'm definitely glad I went with the 17"" this time. The screen real estate is really nice on-the-go, as this doubles as a work machine and gaming laptop for me. When I'm at home, I have an external monitor I use for more work space. No issues there.

Where it really shines is the cooling on this bad boy. I bought some simple, adhesive laptop legs to raise the back up so it can breathe better (Anybody whose got knowledge of gaming laptops knows this works just as well as a ""cooling pad""). Even under maximum load, the GPU only runs at about 87C, and after 5 hours of intense AAA gaming, the hottest it ever got was 89C. Vapor chamber, raising the laptop, and the bigger foot print of this laptop overall really helps dissipate the heat.

The on-board sound isn't terrible either. Of course I did some tweaking on the mixer to dial it in but it can get pretty damn loud.

Speaking of noise, this thing runs impressively quiet. Especially when I'm not playing the most DEMANDING games, it's completely tolerable even without headphones. I owned an ASUS TUF laptop a couple years ago and that thing was like sticking your head inside a vaccum cleaner.

The 3070 Ti in this model being able to push 150W when needed really squeezes every bit of performance out of this card. Very happy I went with this, over the 4060. I understand the newer card draws less power for similar performance, and has access to DLSS 3.0, but running at 2k this is more than enough.

From the first day, it's acting weird. Fan makes huge noise. Laptop gets very hot that I barely can touch it. In so many times screen turns black while running games and it stops the game and other times it just restart on its own even though the laptop just started. This is $6000 CAD laptop that we talk about, not a cheap machine.",0
B0B443GX48,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,13 April 2022,the United States,False,"This will likely be the last Razer device I've purchased. I really want to remain loyal to the company but I've recently bought things such as keyboards, mice and others that just didn't cut the mustard. For whatever reason though, I decided to drop 4k on a top of the line laptop to replace my 6 year old Origin PC. That was a mistake.

Let's start however, with the positives.

The computer is slick. I bought a Blade 17 with 32gb of RAM and a 3080TI. It's super thin, easily 40% thinner than my 6 year old Origin and very light for a 17 inch laptop (comparatively speaking). The screen is beautiful, crisp and bright and you definitely notice the 240hz in QHD. It's fantastic.

It's also surprisingly quiet. I expected more fan noise but there is very little to be honest. I bought a laptop cooler just in case because I wanted to protect my new baby from overheating but it seems to do well on it's own. I've never seen the GPU heat go above 58 degrees Celsius in any game thus far.

When I got it ready and got my games installed, I was very pleased. The computer could easily push 140 FPS in the most demanding games and still didn't feel hot to the touch. It crushed anything I loaded and I briefly debating using this in lieu of my personally built desktop with a 3070 and 32gb of ram because I felt this laptop was outperforming it in many regards. Unfortunately, that lasted about two weeks.

Suddenly I started seeing artifacts and flickers in games. Previous experience instantly told me that is not a good sign. My FPS dropped dramatically. Whereas in my favorite shooters I was seeing between 70 and 120 FPS, I now see 40 at the most, usually 35 or less. Nothing I do changes this. Every game looks great but runs awful.

I ran additional benchmarks on the computer to see what was wrong. The GPU is now benchmarking at ZERO percent after just two weeks. Either I got a lemon of a GPU or perhaps the chassis cooling is not what i's cracked up to be. Either way, spending four THOUSAND dollars on what should be a premier gaming laptop and it lasting all of two weeks is beyond unacceptable. Spending 4000 dollars on anything should all but guarantee and near perfectly functioning device. Sadly, that is not what I received.

I received something that performed slightly above where I expected for about two weeks. However, after two weeks, my 6 year old Origin PC with a GTX 570 can actually play my favorite games at a higher FPS than this computer.

It would appear that Razer's QC is once again lacking. I would stay away from this laptop and consider a different brand.

Edit:

6 Months later. Razer fixed the problem with the FPS. It took 3 months and required them to send me a new power brick because the one I had was the problem and not feeding sufficient power to the computer. Fast forward another 2 months and the touchpad stopped working. Because Razer makes trash, low quality products with no QC.

STAY AWAY!

From the moment you perform the simpliest task, the fans come on, stay on, and lord help you if you decide to do anything CPU intensive.

I've owned a lot of laptops over the years, and a lot of Acer laptops. The prior generation of this Aspire model had zero fan noise most of the time. And it is 100% on Acer's lap here, as they prevent any form of real control in the bios, and further, decided to be over aggressive re: cooling.

Quite literally, CPUs at 40C are not hot, yet the fans are blaring.

The keyboard? Wow. Just beyond terrible. For starters, for absolutely no reason, they moved keys around. The delete key is now an overstretch above delete, moved to there the 'home' key used to be. The up/down arrow keys have much less height, and are basically randomly responsive due to their tiny nature.

These are *primary keys*, used in consoles, for editing documents, used all the time! Primary keys here!

And the entire space-bar role is smaller height wise, making the space bar itself more finikity, more apt to not register randomly, for left/right edge hits are more difficult to hit center mass. It's a disaster.

There is even some weird lag when coming off of shift, so that when typing quickly, shift is 'sticky', resulting in shift events that should not happen. EG, there is a 10ms or some such delay in shift realising it has been released.

There are even double type events on all keys, again due to the horrible, chicklet keyboard feel.

If you are a sysadmin, or type a lot, RUN AWAY from this laptop. You won't be happy here, at all.

Pros
1. It runs on PCIe 4.0, which was one of the main changes from Comet Lake to Tiger Lake. This means that this laptop reads and writes double what my PCIe 3.0 system does.
2. Intel Core i7 11800H. Yes, the processor is locked, but man, this thing is scorching fast. It is an 8 core, 10 nm design and just rolls. I have read many reviews that called Tiger Lake 11900 a waste of money, but many also said that the best performance to money were the 8 core i7's from Tiger Lake. I agree.
3. RTX 3060. It should really be the ti version for the price. 6GB is fine for my Mother, but for me, 8GB is the minimum amount. Still, Nvidia Ampere cards are good value and perform well.
4. Lit keyboard. Beautiful colors, but again, should be all keys, not just 4 zone.
5. Monitor. This is also falling into cons. It is very bright and easy to see. 144hz is more than enough frankly, and it scrolls nice.
6. Cooling solution. It is good. Not quite as good as my Predator Triton 500, but much better than that ASUS I spoke of.
7. Thunderbolt 4. Good stuff here. A definite upgrade.
8. Wifi 6. Also, a major upgrade for Wifi.
9. Ease of upgrading. So simple. Just take the screws out of the back and get yourself a set of PC specific plastic pry tools. DO NOT USE METAL SCREDRIVERS! Those will scratch and damage. Once you remove the bottom plate, you have access to everything. You can change RAM, add another SSD, clean the fans, change out the mousepad, on and on. Great design IMO.

Cons
1. Monitor. Should be Gsync and also, the colors are not as vivid as my Predator Triton 500, which I can't understand. The gamut is very similar so I don't know. Not bad but could be better.
2. Should be 32GB of ram. DDR4 is still fine, but I am upgrading from 16 to 32. Many programs just use so much ram: Chrome absolutely sucks up resources.
3. Price. Not bad, but should be a little less. I think for this price it should have come with either 32 GB of DDR4, or that 3060 Ti.
4. Storage is not great. For some it is fine. If you game, you need to add a 2nd SSD. 512 GB is not good when you consider how big games are now. Luckily it does have a spot for a 2nd SSD, so that is simple.
5. Loud fans. Doesn't bother me, but it might bother some. They can be loud when under load, but you can control this using the Acer PredatorSense App.

SUMMARY

Mostly good value. I think the Tiger Lake CPU is scorching fast paired with the Samsung NVME running on PCIe 4.0. The screen is nice at 144hz. The keyboard types well, and the cooling keeps the system at a safe temp. Granted, Tiger Lake chips can go to 100 C, but that is too hot. Should have come with a slightly better GPU for the price. Either a 3060 Ti or maybe a regular 3070 for example. Cheap and simple to do the RAM upgrade as well. I recommend this one for a gamer, or an average user. It will surprise you if you are coming from an 8th-10th generation Intel Chip, or maybe AM1-AM3 from AMD.

B09YSXYV5F,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,6 November 2023,the United States,False,"I figured I’d go ahead and help others by writing this due to the fact after hours of research myself before this purchase I was unable to get clear details on a gaming laptop specific to the needs I was looking for so here we go.

To keep it short, I needed a laptop powerful enough to stream in 2k, record at the same time as well in 2k (2160p 60fps) all while playing games that require high end specs in order to do so smoothly without lags or crashes. So the big thing for me was to still be within a budget that was reasonable and capable of doing this without having to purchase a pc that could cost a couple or few thousands of dollars.

To say the least this is hands down the best purchase I’ve made on my end. To cut to the chase I can now stream, record and multitask and have multiple windows open with all my games on high or ultra/custom settings with no issues at all. I play PUBG with my settings at ultra, (2 on high settings) and still getting anywhere between 110 - 130 fps while streaming and recording simultaneously. I play new world on very high/high settings and getting anywhere between 60 - 80fps and of course higher fps depending on the area I am with less player base. So to say the least yes this laptop is 100% worth the money and in my eyes affordable for someone on a budget so it’s an absolute steal. The only “downside” and I put that in quotes because I have a laptop stand with cooling fans are the fans on the laptop itself so get hot but cools off when I turn on my cooler fans. Other than that this laptop is my main power source for my 4k 27inch curved monitor, 4k streaming camera, ring lights, and all other accessories so to say the least, yes, I am really pushing this laptop as much as possible however after a month use it is working phenomenal and I don’t see myself upgrading for another three or four years. In conclusion if you are someone like myself looking to save money, but still have a high end product that’s capable of so much this is it.

Specifically the AN515-46-R0EQ. I just fired this product up today and needed to leave my first impressions. It is a 2023 model that includes ddr5 ram. But it’s different than the ones many are reviewing.

Boot: was not DOA. For people claiming DOA, make sure your power cord is fully plugged in. There is an audible as well as tensile click.

BIOS: coming to this from an MSI build, it’s archaic. Only a few options. But less is more and it’s clean.

Upgrades: when I bought this laptop, I also bought an additional 4tb m.2 2280 and a 5tb hdd because the store page said it had space for them. When I opened up the case, I found that the AN515-46-R0EQ not only didn’t come with the cable to connect it, but is physically missing the header to attach it. After checking the Acer website and looking up the model, I see this model CANNOT connect a 2.5 drive. So I wasted money because of a bad presentation. MAKE SURE TO CHECK WHAT YOU'RE BUYING!

Windows install and syncing: Everything synced, installed, and updated very quickly.

So far so good. Now I just need to install Steam and she how it handles. Will update this within the next couple days

Update 2 weeks later for gaming:
Well I’m happy with this for sure. Final Fantasy VII Remake on max settings (which has a notoriously rough side for graphics plays flawlessly, and Elden Ring on max only has some stutters in Liurnia when it’s raining. I’m running through Farum Azula now (giant tornado) and have had no issues. 58fps when capped at 60 anyway at 1440p. Looks beautiful.

Kicked this up to 5 stars since it’s fantastic for what it does.

B09YFVNK2Q,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,10 January 2023,the United States,False,"I could give an opinion on what brands I think are “good” versus “budget”, but I’ve proven my generic opinions wrong a couple of times now.

I wasn’t sure about Lenovo for my last laptop, but for the hardware/specs at the time, I got it for a good price. That Lenovo laptop has been so solid for me that it’s been my primary computer for 10 years (i.e. always used, always on), and is still “my primary” for now, and what I’m currently writing this review on. But it has been showing it’s “tech age” lately. So it’s (sadly) time to upgrade.

Acer, to me, has always seemed like the “Wally special”; Cheap construction and lower spec hardware. And, in fairness, Acer has and does cater to the budget (sub-$300) laptop market. I looked around…and saw that this laptop has great specs for the price range that I intended to pay for a laptop (sub-500). It appears that Acer has better-spec'd/mid-market products as well. So I went to the computer store that had a similar, but less-spec’d model, to check it out. For construction, it just a little flimsy, but no worse than others; so this seems to be where laptops are now…really lightweight, but a little flimsy. Admittedly though, some still have, and I would have preferred, aluminum construction, but tradeoffs. So I ordered this.

The tech specs included in this for the price are very good. Notably:

-12th Gen. i5 processor.

-8GB DDR4 ram is “on par”, but the ram is 4GBx2 slot, and replaceable (i.e. not soldered in), upgradeable to 32GB (16GBx2).

-One Gen3 PCIE slot (with a default installed 512GB Gen3 SSD), and also a Gen4 slot, and room for a 2.5 SSD if you prefer (with an adapter). I swapped the Gen3 512GB SSD with a 1TB Gen4 SSD, both of which work(ed) well. ***Note that the pics reflect the new drive, not OEM***

- The screen is bright and vivid, enough for my liking anyway. “Iris Xe” graphics, apparently integrated graphics board, so good enough for basic gaming, but not great or upgradeable.

- Sound is a little “tinny” but I don’t expect too much from laptop speakers. One odd thing to note is that the speakers are on the front bottom of the laptop. I’d prefer them on top though.

-Thunderbolt 4 USB-c port. 10 Gbps fast (tested/confirmed), and will charge peripheral devices. And, yes, I tested/charged the laptop successfully with a USB-c charger through the TB4 port.

- Other USB ports are also USB 3+ (blue).

-HDMI, and speaker/mic ports, as expected.

-Wifi6 NIC which is fast and great…but this laptop also (still) has an onboard 1GB RJ-45 network port, which I use often in testing/when I need dual NICs or GB speed.

- The InsydeH2O UEFI is rather basic compared to other laptop firmware, but I suppose it’s adequate. It has very limited options/configurability, and no support for CSM or BIOS/legacy-mode.

- No mem-card slot.

- It has a Kensington lock port, though I personally have never uses these. But I guess it’s nice to have.

- I like the grey, sleek look of it.

-It comes with Win 11 Home, (which is downgrade-able to Win 10 if you prefer).

Bottom Line:

I’d have preferred Aluminum/sturdier construction and more robust UEFI/BIOS, which you might find in higher (i.e. double) priced laptops, along with some (perhaps) sturdier components. But the hardware/specs are very robust for this price point! This Acer laptop is testing well so far, and is currently in the process of replacing an aged, but great, Lenovo laptop. Good buy…hopefully it last as long as my last laptop!

B09YFVNK2Q,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,28 November 2022,the United States,False,"I may be showing my age a bit but my first PC was an 'IBM XT clone' with a 40 megabyte hard drive and a 'full height' 5 1/4 floppy drive that weighed several pounds. Most computers ran DOS at the time but I was a 'trendsetter' when I loaded Windows 3.0 on my computer. lol Fast forward more years than I care to admit, I picked up the Acer Aspire 5 (i5) model.

I've had the laptop for just a few days, ran it through its paces and even took it apart to see what things I can change/add to it. The only thing I'm slightly disappointed with is that my particular laptop came with (2) 4 GB memory cards instead of (1) 8 GB memory card. On the bright side, neither are permanent so I'll have more flexibility if I decide to upgrade the memory. While I had the back cover off, I was happy to see that I can easily add a second PCIe drive or a SSD drive. (I've ask Santa to get me a 1 TB PCIe drive and I'm hopeful I'll get it cause I've been pretty good this past year.) :D

Comparing the specs between the i5 and the i7, the biggest thing for me was the Thunderbolt 4 port on the I5 which the i7 did not have. (That really surprised me.) This one little port is AMAZING because you can connect it to a Docking Station and the sky is the limit. I picked up the Fusion5 (14 in 1) docking station that allows me to add 3 monitors, a 100 watt charger (which charges the laptop), and a lot of other ports. In short, this one port allows this laptop to go from a 'laptop' to a full blown 'desktop' by connecting just one cable.

Getting back to the laptop, it's definitely worth the money (especially when it's on sale). I love that you can easily upgrade the RAM and add additional storage space. It's nice that the keyboard is 'backlit' but the annoying part is that it turns off after 30 seconds (when not typing). HOWEVER, there is a setting in the BIOS that will keep the 'backlight' on all the time. (You can see how to do it on YouTube and ACER's website has instructions as well.)

B09V7CS1DY,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,3 November 2022,the United States,False,"I purchased this computer hoping for a simple personal machine and I can honestly say I will never purchase another Lenovo product.

Approximately 4 weeks after the return window closed on this, my laptop would start freezing. It isn't like I was trying to play complex games or run 100 apps at once, just watching a youtube video or checking the daily news after 10-15 minutes the computer would consistently freeze. Then I discovered in the alerts center that a windows update may not have installed correctly, so I tried to reinstall it. Still freezing. So I tried to do a ""reset"" to just start windows fresh again. The computer froze during the reset and now will not even boot.

Time wasted contacting amazon support and lenovo support and I am going to be mailing this thing in.

This computer was supposed to replace a 9 year old Dell laptop that uses windows 8. That laptop still works by the way. I learned my lesson!",0

I ordered a windows 11 laptop and after setting it up completely I noticed it was a windows 10. I didn’t want to send it back and reached out to the seller to see if they can provide me with the missing windows.
Their response “ We are very sorry, this is our staff's mistake, please follow the following steps, if you have any questions please contact us in time, thank you for your understanding
To check if Windows 11 is ready for your device, go to Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and select Check for updates. If the upgrade is available for your device and you want to proceed, download and install it”.
Now I’m computer savvy but some people are not!!! I don’t like leaving bad reviews but this item is not cheap and some people require the help of others to set them up!!!! Originally I checked on that windows 11 update and although the laptop met the requirements it was asking me to pay a cost of approximately 200 bucks and that’s when I reached out to the seller!!! Upon doing so I noticed other complaints of customers not receiving the right items! I don’t know how they resolved their issues but I’m letting you know of my experience! So dear seller although I understand human error I think your response is poor and lacks responsibility!!

As for a review of the laptop itself I give it 5 stars!! I had done my research prior to the purchase and so it meets my standards. I would recommend this laptop to anyone just beware of this seller!!!

B09V2S7LQX,Amazon Customer,5.0,Brilliant Laptop!,11 November 2019,the United Kingdom,False,"After spending a while looking around online for a new gaming laptop, I decided to take a chance ordering this product, and I'm happy to inform you that I was not disappointed. After seeing the eye-watering prices most retailers want for a decent laptop setup I was intrigued by this product and the relatively low price (Plus a 5% discount Voucher).
I ordered my laptop with the following specifications... 24GB Ram, 256GB SSD, 1 TB HHD, NVIDA GeForce GTX 1050 Graphics Card, 15.6"" Full HD . After placing my order I started to receive messages from the seller. The first was to notify me of the customs fee that I would have to pay to have the laptop imported from Hong Kong. I can't remember seeing this anywhere on the item description. They told me that they would ship the laptop as ""low-value item"". The fee I paid was £84. This was fairly simple to do through the couriers (DHL) website. I then recieved a message saying that there was a slight delay in the order, about 5 days. The next message I received from the seller was to tell me they were going to upgrade the processor and send me a free mouse and bag with the laptop. The laptop arrived about a month later (3 days earlier than the later delivery date) with my free gifts. The actual make of the laptop is ""Hasee"" and is one of their ""God of War"" models. The model name is stenciled on the front of the latop and appears on screen while the computer is booting up. The laptop came with Windows 10 pro pre-installed and included a Windows 10 pro CD-Rom for back-up. This laptop does not have an on-board CD drive, like many gaming laptops. Specifications wise, the laptop came with everything I had ordered. It boots up super fast and I have had no problems with it in my first week of use. Any computer retailers in the UK would probably ask about £2000 for a laptop with similar hardware, so im very happy that mine has only cost me £768. The only downside I have experienced so far, is that the laptop is built using the US keyboard layout. Something I didn't consider when ordering. Although this can be simply fixed by changing the language settings on your operating system. I have done this and bought a set of keyboard stickers for £1.49, to cover up the keys that had changed. The last message I received from the seller was a request for a review and in exchange I would recieve a £20 refund. Although I understand that this now makes my review seem like a paid advertisement, I hope you can see I have tried to be as honest and informative as possible. And to be fair, who wouldn't like a £20 discount?
In summary, I ordered a latop with fairly high specifications and it does a great job. There was a hidden customs fee of £84 added on to the price of the product, but I still feel that I got a great product for a bargain price!

B09V2S7LQX,D. McBain,5.0,Great laptop for the price,30 December 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"Using the product to write this review, so we're off to a good start. There are a few downsides to this purchase and will list both good and bad. It is a Chinese brand (actually a Hasee not a Homei) and is shipped, I assume, by sea - it took 3 months to arrive, but the sellers made no pretence otherwise, so if you want something tomorrow, it's not the one for you, but if you want great value and a high spec and are prepared to wait for it, then read on. Shortly after buying the seller contacted me and explained that as it would take a while to arrive, they were going to upgrade the memory and the graphics card. They were as good as their word and they contacted me regularly with updates on when it was going to arrive, so I never felt concern on non arrival.
As it was shipped from China, there were customs fees - the seller refunded me £50 which went a fair way towards covering these. Nice touch.
The photos on amazon aren't great - they make it look like a massive wedge - the laptop itself is pretty slim, so don't let that put you off.
Only other really minor (for me at least) negative is that it arrived with US English as the default and a US keyboard (@ where "" should be and # where the £ should be) - fixable by adding UK English as default in windows and ignoring what it says on the buttons.
The positives outwiegh these issues by a mile. It boots in no time. I can now run more tabs in my browser than I will ever need, I do photo processing and can whizz through pictures at way faster speeds than I ever could before. Windows was installed, set up and ready to go on arrival - and is easy to customise if needed.

B09V1LLJNJ,Amazon Customer,5.0,Brilliant Laptop!,11 November 2019,the United Kingdom,False,"After spending a while looking around online for a new gaming laptop, I decided to take a chance ordering this product, and I'm happy to inform you that I was not disappointed. After seeing the eye-watering prices most retailers want for a decent laptop setup I was intrigued by this product and the relatively low price (Plus a 5% discount Voucher).
I ordered my laptop with the following specifications... 24GB Ram, 256GB SSD, 1 TB HHD, NVIDA GeForce GTX 1050 Graphics Card, 15.6"" Full HD . After placing my order I started to receive messages from the seller. The first was to notify me of the customs fee that I would have to pay to have the laptop imported from Hong Kong. I can't remember seeing this anywhere on the item description. They told me that they would ship the laptop as ""low-value item"". The fee I paid was £84. This was fairly simple to do through the couriers (DHL) website. I then recieved a message saying that there was a slight delay in the order, about 5 days. The next message I received from the seller was to tell me they were going to upgrade the processor and send me a free mouse and bag with the laptop. The laptop arrived about a month later (3 days earlier than the later delivery date) with my free gifts. The actual make of the laptop is ""Hasee"" and is one of their ""God of War"" models. The model name is stenciled on the front of the latop and appears on screen while the computer is booting up. The laptop came with Windows 10 pro pre-installed and included a Windows 10 pro CD-Rom for back-up. This laptop does not have an on-board CD drive, like many gaming laptops. Specifications wise, the laptop came with everything I had ordered. It boots up super fast and I have had no problems with it in my first week of use. Any computer retailers in the UK would probably ask about £2000 for a laptop with similar hardware, so im very happy that mine has only cost me £768. The only downside I have experienced so far, is that the laptop is built using the US keyboard layout. Something I didn't consider when ordering. Although this can be simply fixed by changing the language settings on your operating system. I have done this and bought a set of keyboard stickers for £1.49, to cover up the keys that had changed. The last message I received from the seller was a request for a review and in exchange I would recieve a £20 refund. Although I understand that this now makes my review seem like a paid advertisement, I hope you can see I have tried to be as honest and informative as possible. And to be fair, who wouldn't like a £20 discount?
In summary, I ordered a latop with fairly high specifications and it does a great job. There was a hidden customs fee of £84 added on to the price of the product, but I still feel that I got a great product for a bargain price!

B09V1LLJNJ,D. McBain,5.0,Great laptop for the price,30 December 2020,the United Kingdom,False,"Using the product to write this review, so we're off to a good start. There are a few downsides to this purchase and will list both good and bad. It is a Chinese brand (actually a Hasee not a Homei) and is shipped, I assume, by sea - it took 3 months to arrive, but the sellers made no pretence otherwise, so if you want something tomorrow, it's not the one for you, but if you want great value and a high spec and are prepared to wait for it, then read on. Shortly after buying the seller contacted me and explained that as it would take a while to arrive, they were going to upgrade the memory and the graphics card. They were as good as their word and they contacted me regularly with updates on when it was going to arrive, so I never felt concern on non arrival.
As it was shipped from China, there were customs fees - the seller refunded me £50 which went a fair way towards covering these. Nice touch.
The photos on amazon aren't great - they make it look like a massive wedge - the laptop itself is pretty slim, so don't let that put you off.
Only other really minor (for me at least) negative is that it arrived with US English as the default and a US keyboard (@ where "" should be and # where the £ should be) - fixable by adding UK English as default in windows and ignoring what it says on the buttons.
The positives outwiegh these issues by a mile. It boots in no time. I can now run more tabs in my browser than I will ever need, I do photo processing and can whizz through pictures at way faster speeds than I ever could before. Windows was installed, set up and ready to go on arrival - and is easy to customise if needed.

Installed Windows Subsystem for Android to run android apps. Virtually installed Windows 7 and Windows 10 using VMWare Workstation Pro just to test out how this laptop handles virtualization. I am very pleased with this machine.

Purchased this Asus VivoBook 14 for $249.99. Very good price for a full HD device with an Intel Core i3-1215U CPU. Once installed this laptop boots in seconds.
With a quick web search, I easily installed Windows 11 without a Microsoft account, I prefer an offline local account instead. I removed Windows 11 in S mode to make it Windows 11 Home and uninstalled some preloaded apps. This laptop has 1 empty slot for additional RAM so I added a Crucial 8GB DDR4 3200 RAM to bring this machine to 12GB (this is the maximum it will support). Upgrading RAM and storage is easy. It has 128GB internal storage which isn't much but is enough for me at the moment. Will upgrade the internal storage later. I updated Windows and used the preloaded MyASUS app to update the bios and drivers. Changed settings in Battery Health Charging so the battery doesn't charge past 80 percent which will prolong the battery life. This machine is slim and light weight, easy to carry, looks nice and has a physical webcam privacy cover, has a nice back lit keyboard(but I turn it off to save battery) I Haven't tested the camera or microphone yet. Has a 3.5mm audio jack and WIFI 6. Screen looks very nice. Built in speakers are good. Overall this is a very good buy.

B09SVSBVP1,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,16 April 2025,the United States,False,"For the price, this laptop gets a 5 star rating. Well, more like 4.5 but I couldn't give it that. It's a good sized laptop with a clear screen. It's pretty darn fast and it looks pretty sharp. Speakers are decent but not mind-blowing and for what it's worth, it has a camera, which is, again, passable, not mind-blowing. The keyboard on the one I got is more of a darker grey (it's advertised as ash grey, which I believe is a lighter color) but I actually like the darker keyboard better. Typing on the keyboard is pretty smooth too. It could use one or two more outlets on the sides though. You only get one USB Type-A port, one USB Type-C port and a headphone jack. Fine if you're more of a minimalist, but not ideal for multi-tasking work. Also, a little tip; When powering on, all you need to do is press the power button, NOT press and hold. I didn't realize that at first and thought initially that their was a problem. Just a piece of advice. Overall, it's a good laptop, at a fair price and should work well for the ""Average Joe"".

B09ST1W2NS,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,7 December 2022,the United States,False,"TL;DR: Biggest Problems: The IR camera for Windows Hello works about 50% of the time. The Fingerprint Scanner works maybe 70% of the time. The magnet for the MSI Pen is in a stupid location.

I purchased this laptop to be a thin-and-light workbook for work and leisure. I have always appreciated MSI products, and wanted to experience their new productivity lineup. The MSI pen and convertible feature were very enticing to me, as well as the dual Thunderbolt 4 ports with power delivery capability. Having a HDMI and a privacy switch for the camera was a nice touch.

The laptop setup was easy from the fresh windows 11 install. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, though the arrow keys are cramped, and I find myself hitting pgup/home when trying to move through text. The touch pad is appropriately positioned and sized appropriately, though the left click already feels spongy and does not feel like good build quality. When I purchased the laptop, I overlooked that the function keys did not have a dedicated media control (Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous) so you will need to alt-tab to your music or media apps to pause music.

The MSI Pen attaches to the laptop in only one spot; the left, front side of the laptop, far away from most dexterous (right handed) individuals. The magnets are relatively weak compared to other laptops I have used, such as the Microsoft Book 2. I would have loved to have magnets at the side of the screen to hold the pen in place between typing sessions. The other oversight is that the pen's current magnet position blocks one of the two Thunderbolt Ports. At this point, the pen lives in my bag more than it lives on the laptop.

Battery life is good for a productivity laptop, where I can work for 8-10 hours between charging, with accommodating screen brightness. The laptop charges quickly, and has worked well with non-OEM chargers that support the PD Protocol.

I have been able to complete some light gaming with the integrated graphics. I have been able to play World of Warcraft WotLK Classic. With medium/high settings at native resolution, I have been able to maintain 60 fps consistently with no stuttering or frame drops. The laptop will get a bit warm, but is tolerable to have on your lap, or have your hands resting on the keyboard.

My biggest complaint is that if the PC is left in sleep mode for a prolonged time, more often than not, the Windows Hello feature is unable to initiate when you turn the device on again. Half the time I get a message stating that the camera is unavailable, please log in using PIN. I had thought at first that the camera privacy switch had been toggled, but it was still in the ""enable webcam"" state. The Fingerprint sensor is more robust and is able to unlock the pc 70% of the time, but occasionally it is unable to initialize either. I do wish the fingerprint sensor had a more defined edge to it so that it can be felt by touch. The edge is so flush that I have to look to ensure my finger is on the pad fully for signing in.

Ultimately I do like the laptop, but there are many aspects that should be improved upon for the next iteration. If this PC broke today, I probably would not purchase this model again, and I would opt for a Dell XPS 13 or other similar convertible.

Me fue mejor que la TUF 2021 que estaba en 30k

Aunque no la usare principalmente para jugar, he probado algunos juegos y corre bastante bien el Gears 5, Halo TMCC, Halo Infinite, la temperatura es adecuada y como todo dispositivo requerirá sus mantenimientos oportunos, Para jugar prefiero usar mis consolas o bien la de escritorio que puedo exigirle el máximo sin preocuparme de las temperaturas.

Para la programación, programas de edición y gráficos es muy buen equipo, es una buena compra para cualquier estudiante que requiera de un equipo con buenas prestaciones.

El equipo de 16GB de RAM y SSD de 500GB a como viene de fabrica es excelente, si puedes agrégale más RAM o bien aumenta el SSD que 500GB los consumes en poco tiempo.

Pros:
-Procesador de última generación
-Memoria RAM DDR5
-Slot extra M.2
-Buena duración de batería 4-6 hrs en modo Eco
-Diseño sobrio, excelente que la iluminación sea blanco y no el árbol de navidad rgb
-Touchpad de muy buen tamaño
-Teclado Completo
-Pantalla más que excelente
-Puertos USB C, HDMI es excelente que aún incluya este puerto.
-Buen sonido, bastante equilibrado
-Buenos materiales de construcción

Contras:
-SSD de fabrica muy sencillo
-16GB en 2x8GB lo que te obliga a comprar 2 memorias para expandir
-Cámara web justa

B09R5VYRVN,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,16 November 2024,the United States,False,"The Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-32DK Slim Laptop is a well-rounded, budget-friendly laptop designed for users seeking a reliable device for schoolwork, light productivity, and entertainment. With a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS display and an 11th Gen Intel i3-1115G4 dual-core processor, this laptop offers a good balance of performance and portability, ideal for students and casual users.

Pros
Good Overall Speed and Performance:
The laptop's 11th Gen Intel i3-1115G4 processor, paired with a 128GB NVMe SSD, delivers snappy performance for daily tasks such as web browsing, document editing, and streaming videos. Boot times and application launches are quick, making it a responsive choice for schoolwork and entertainment.

Upgradeable DDR4 RAM:
One standout feature of the Acer Aspire 5 is its upgradability. While it comes with 4GB of DDR4 RAM, users can easily upgrade the memory to improve multitasking capabilities. This flexibility extends the laptop’s lifespan, making it a great choice for those needing more power in the future.

Slim, Portable Design:
The sleek, slim design of the Acer Aspire 5 makes it highly portable, fitting comfortably in most backpacks or bags. Despite its lightweight build, it maintains a sturdy feel, making it well-suited for students on the go.

Windows 11 Home Edition:
The laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Home in S Mode, which provides enhanced security and streamlined performance. For users who prefer more flexibility, it’s easy to switch out of S Mode, which allows for full access to third-party software while retaining the fresh interface and features of Windows 11.

Expandability to Dual External Screens:
The Acer Aspire 5 supports connections to two external monitors, making it a practical choice for multitaskers or users who need more screen real estate for work or entertainment. This expandability adds versatility, enhancing productivity for students and casual users alike.

Cons
Performance Slowdown During Initial Software Updates:
About two to three weeks after purchase, the system experienced noticeable slowdowns during software updates, likely due to background processes and updates from Windows 11. However, the performance returned to normal after about a week. While this may have been an issue with initial system updates, it was a temporary inconvenience and did not impact long-term usability.

Final Verdict
The Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-32DK Slim Laptop is an excellent value for its price, offering strong performance, upgradability, and a sleek design. Its fast processor, Full HD display, and the flexibility to expand RAM make it a capable device for students and casual users looking for a dependable laptop for schoolwork, media consumption, and multitasking.

Overall, this laptop is 5 out of 5 stars. It delivers a great combination of speed, expandability, and portability, making it a solid choice for those seeking a budget-friendly, reliable laptop for everyday use.

B09R5VYRVN,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,25 June 2024,the United States,False,"First off, it has a compact chiclet keyboard which has a useful numpad making it versatile for all office/school work and even light gaming.

The 1080p screen is crisp and vibrant which makes it great for watching videos or reading documents.

The battery life is meh. It may last around 12 hours with battery saver on and light use, but still I would like for it to push more.

Now for the bad stuff. The construction and build is horrible. It uses like a magnesium aluminum alloy which is cheap, weak, and brittle. When you type you can feel the entire plate press down and retract back up. Also when I unscrewed and pulled the bottom panel off, I may have broken the retaining tabs.

This laptop only comes with 4gb which is barely enough to do anything. I ended up buying an 8gb ram card which fortunately this laptop does have a spare slot for upgrading. Doing so will probably lead to you breaking the inside tabs like I mentioned.

The most annoying part is the loud fans at the bottom. Even when just scrolling through documents it insists on revving up. I could not imagine using this at a meeting or even at a lecture.

Overall, it's solid if you just want a laptop to use at home and perform light tasks. Considering this was the cheapest 1080p LCD laptop (when I bought it), its pretty competent apart from my mentioned qualms. After 1 year its still holding up fine.
I would however advice to look at getting used or even new Thinkpads from Lenovo instead since, in hindsight, they seem to be a lot cheaper as well as being higher spec.

B09QF58J7T,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,9 December 2022,the United States,False,"This is a great mini laptop if you intend to use it for light-duty applications such as email, social media, internet browsing, internet shopping, Microsoft Word and Excel (Office 365), etc. It is not intended for heavy-duty applications such as gaming (good gaming laptops are $1,000+, not $150 to $200). The laptop does not have the processor speed, graphics card, memory or storage to handle high-demand applications. If you purchase the laptop for what it is intended for, your experience will be much better.

The laptop is about as small as you would want if you are a touch typist and prefer a normal size keyboard. The keyboard provides good key travel and feedback and the touch pad can be used as a numeric key pad (a major plus for many users). As some of noted in their reviews, the keyboard is not lighted. However, the display normally provides enough light to use the laptop in the dark. Also, given the laptop's battery size, you would not really want the additional power draw on the battery.

The battery will provide a good 10 to 20 hours of usage depending on what you are doing on the laptop. That said, when the laptop is shutdown, the battery does drain by approximately 20% each day. After several days of not using the laptop, you will need to plug it in to turn it on. This power consumption when shutdown is not so much a battery issue as an operating system setting. The laptop operates on Windows 11 S (intended for Microsoft approved applications) and it is specifically designed for quick startup. The startup time is similar to that of a Chrome Book. If you recall the small netbooks that preceded Chrome Books--this small laptop is a much better and much more capable netbook. For my purposes, I will gladly give up the additional battery life for the ability to quickly startup the laptop.

The laptop has a great display. It is not a touch screen for those who want that feature. However, the display was clear, detailed and bright when watching highlights of the World Cup soccer games and when surfing the internet. The size and price of the laptop are very appealing--just make sure that you truly consider what you will be using it for.

Ich habe neben diesem Gerät die Matebooks mit mit 2k und 2.5 K Display probiert - Matebook 14 und 16:

HUAWEI MateBook 16 | 16.1"" 2.5K Fullview Display | AMD Ryzen 5-5600H | 16GB RAM |
HUAWEI MateBook 14 | 14"" 2K Fullview Touch Display | Core i7-1165G7 | 16GB RAM | 512GB SSD

Bei allen Modellen mit 2k und 2.5 K Display ist starkes Backlight Bleeding bei hellem Bildschirm zu beobachten. Also die unregelmäßige Hintergrundbeleuchtung am Rand des Bildschirmes, die wirklich nicht zu übersehen und stark störend ist, wenn man bspw. Filme mit schwarzen Balken oben und unten ansieht.
Dieses Modell, bzw. die D Modelle haben zwar kein 2.k oder 2.5K, sondern ""nur"" Full HD, aber in Anbetracht der Backlight Bleeding Problematik ist mir das tausend Mal lieber.
An diesem Modell gibt es nichts auszusetzen - Preis-Leistung unschlagbar, gute Leistung, Design passt und ist gut verarbeitet.
Außerdem muss ich anmerken, dass dieses Modell, also die D Modelle extrem leise sind - die Belüftung ist beim Browsing so gut wie nie an - absolut leise - nicht ein Ton. Selbst wenn die Belüftung loslegt, ist sie sehr leise und nicht störend.
Beim Matebook 14 ging sie ständig an - ich glaube im Testbericht gelesen zu haben, es liegt an dem Intel Core i7 Prozessor - auch bei 5 % CPU Belastung legte sie los und war laut wie ein Fön - unzumutbar.
Beim Matebook 16 - AMD Ryzen - ging sie auch schnell los, war jedoch leise und nicht störend.
Daher würde ich in puncto Lautstärke der Belüftung immer AMD empfehlen. Aspekte die mit der Leistung zusammenhängen, habe ich vernachlässigt, da ich nur browse, ab und an Filme gucke und sonst nur die Office Anwendungen nutze.

The design of the laptop is excellent, very elegant and nice to the touch. The display is awesome and people who work in creative fields like me, usually have to use a separate bigger screen for their work. The bezel is minimal, the screen ratio is excellent.

That's pretty much everything that a person should be looking for in a laptop - capability and design.

The only downside is that the battery might drain a bit too fast when under heavy load and not connected to power, but hey.. with a 16 inch screen and lots of power under the hood.. what would you expect?

The only minor negative surprise is that the HDMI port is not mini but the old school regular one.

I totally recommend it for heavy work and also for gaming. I have run quite a few games on it and they are running flawlessly. Definitely worth the money.

First mine came with over 1.7tb designated for games use it because while it will support up to 1tb micro SD card it will have slight delay and cause some delay that isn't there when it's on the internal HD. The screen casting works, Steam play works, downloading steam games work I have played Grim Dawn and Ark without issue downloaded on the device. Grim Dawn I ran into 1 small issue it's set for Steam Deck gamepad; however, there is in settings an option for non Steam Deck gamepad select it and it works flawlessly. Everything works like it should headphone jack and Bluetooth a go. Now on 7 days to die I tried downloading it and I made it to my groups base and then lag massive lag; however I uninstalled it and tried running it with my desktop through Steam non downloaded and it ran perfect. I will be honest and I truly am not a hardcore gamer no in fact my scores didn't go up any and they didn't really go down any, but I do enjoy the OneXPlayer very much. This is a pad laptop and desktop all rolled into one. Does it replace my gaming VR desktop no but it does allow me to sit back relax and enjoy playing games with my friends without a mouse and keyboard and in spots where I can't take my desktop. I got the AMD 5700u 2tb option and I recommend it. Yes it costs more than a steam deck because 1 it runs on windows 11 mine came ready to put personal information in nothing like the YouTube videos showed much simpler, 2 there is no fingerprint login because it is the power button yes the power button is out of the way and I also got the keyboard and case. The case does it's job and the keyboard works good; now as good as a normal size mouse and keyboard depends if you are playing a game and all you need to do is put a little info in then yes just as good; however doing a paper for school/work then no. To me the price is justified with the product and I have no buyers remorse because I plan on using it at family gatherings for Jack Box games and casting to TV's so the whole family can join in and previously I had to take my desktop to do this because my wife (bless her) smashed my laptop screen 6 years ago and I hadn't found a replacement till now, and even now I was going to wait for Steam Deck because it is cheaper, but 2TB vs 512GB and wait vs no wait. Also OneXPlayer has their own website where they have sales and they can get very competitive with Steam Decks Top End model.

This is for the 8.4"" with the Ryzen 7 5700u.

Cons: The battery isn't great, but that may be the games I'm playing. The turbo comes on automatically, which drains the battery more quickly and it gets warmer when playing titles with serious graphics. I haven't found another charger that works well with it.

Pros: plays AAA games with ease (in over 100 hours of Elden Ring I've only had one frame rate drop that affected playability).

B09NYCP2YG,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,31 August 2022,the United States,False,"This is my second Chromebook, my last Samsung was about 4 years old, and out of updates and the battery was getting tired. So enter the Spin 311. Much improved over the Samsung, especially the display with the Gorilla glass, it's really nice to look at. In tablet mode it really acts like a tablet, although the touch response isn't super responsive, sometimes it takes a double touch to get it moving. I'm learning, a lighter touch works better, but the ability to convert to a tablet is still worth it to me. The key board feel is just amazing, beautiful feel to it, the tactile response i think it's called. Just great. I noticed even with a fully charged battery, when closed in sleep mode, the orange battery charge light blinks slowly as to indicate an error with the battery (it lights up solid orange during charge and turns to blue when fully charged). Anyway I called Acer support and talked to a tech guy in about 2 minutes who claimed it is that way to let you know it's on, and just sleeping as opposed off. I guess I buy that explanation, but it seems a bit strange. My Samsung didn't do that. If you notice it, it's normal behavior i guess. I'll edit with more info as needed, since this is my maiden run so to speak, but I'm pleased so far. There are some questions about SD card slots, this model, 311-2h does indeed have a micro sd card slot, and this 311-2h will get updates until June, 2027. The model of this computer is CP311-2H, from the bottom tag. It's being advertised here as a Spin 311-3H, I don't know the difference between the two model numbers, but makes me wonder if the 2H series is older than the 3H series. It seems a bit deceptive but these model numbers are hard to decipher, so I really don't know.
EDIT to add: In doing a bit more research, it seems the one I received, is a 311-2h (according to the product tag on my Chromebook), and not the 311-3h being advertised. That difference seems to be the 2h is 1 year older than the 3h, and will result in 1 year less of Goggle updates. Also the 3h does not have an SD card reader slot according to specs I've read online, and the 2h does. No telling what you will get from this vendor. The product really should match the product they send out.
Another edit: This is the Chromebook I received https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NTP5RTN/ref=ask_ql_qh_dp_hza?th=1
$199.00 not the $299.00 I paid, kind of looks like a bait and switch, I don't know. I just want a refund for the difference, but I can't contact Amazon customer service, the AI bot that just takes me in circles. I don't want to return it. It's fine, albeit one year older and less updates. Maybe I will get some action by posting here. Buyers maybe beware, honest mistake or not, I don't know. But I do know I didn't receive what was described.

B09NS2SMKP,John Davenne,5.0,A decent laptop for those looking for a good cost/performance balance,16 June 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"This is a great little lappy, i use it for some work and for the odd gaming session when away from home. It was reconditioned, or at least re-boxed and was sold as 'good as new.' I can attest that it was good as new, not a mark, error or issue with its physical appearance or any of its physical characteristics (ports, switches, buttons etc..). No dead pixels, no issues with lighting or screen brightness or sound quality.

The only issue I had was the way it was boxed. It was a Lenovo box, but it merely contained the laptop and power cable. The cable was seemingly just slung in there, although the lappy was well secured, wrapped and encased in foam. No other accessories or paper manuals. Which on reflection, although it would have aided the presentation, did not impinge upon the quality of the system once unboxed.

In review, the only thing that I found a little irritating is the Lenovo bloatware, its a little intrusive, but not a huge problem to remove or customise to be less intrusive.

As for performance, its a great little performer, response time on the screen is good, it has decent connectability, and does not run too hot. The fans can get a little loud, but nothing overly intrusive and this is not an issue at all with headphones. In fairness given the chassis size I'm surprised it is not louder. My previous laptop, a Gigabyte, sounds like a jet fighter with afterburners fully on, that is being amplified through a P.A system. So good effort Lenovo.

Gamewise, I've not encountered any real issues with performance, Cyberpunk runs at ultra with DLSS auto and raytracing on on QHD at about 45-50 FPS, which is actually pretty decent. Clearly dropping settings to high or dropping res will see decent gains that still looks superb. Vermintide 2, although not exactly a system destroyer, looked fantastic on ultra at an average of 80ish, with some drops to the high 60fps with high hoards and larger maps/more detailed scenes. Still perfectly playable and great to look at.

All round, given the cost this was a great buy and I'm really happy as it does all that I need it to and will be a decent out of home workhorse for a couple of years.

B09NS2SMKP,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,18 June 2022,the United States,False,"I am astounded at how great this laptop is. I do want to note that I had mini stutters/snags every 10 seconds or so for most games until I disabled the AMD PSP in the BIOS. Not sure why but that fixed it. After that, this thing runs like a beast.

3070 is fully powered at 130W which is more than enough for most games. The poor AMD 5600H can't quite keep up so there's a bit of a bottleneck but this is still plenty capable of elden ring or GTA at high -max graphics.

I got an excellent cooling pad with it so I'm not sure how the stand-alone cooling is. I do know, however, on the times where it has gotten to CPU temp of 85 (i forgot to turn on cooler) I put my hand all over the laptop and could NOT find a hotspot like so many other gaming laptops.

The screen is beautiful and the matte does a great job of preventing glare and reflections. It is bright and so very crisp. The keyboard feels nice and the whole build quality is just solid. No edgy ""gamer"" look yet not boring. Good gaming-oriented options such as performance modes but fans can not be directly controlled for some reason. There also is no built-in way to check temps so download MSI afterburner. I overclocked mine in the BIOS and saw some performance boost with no drawbacks yet.

Very sleek and fast laptop. Built well and has everything you need, including a webcam. Beyond satisfied with my purchase.

B09NS2SMKP,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,9 March 2023,the United States,False,"I have had multiple gaming laptops over the last 6 years or so, and Lenovo is always my go-to brand. I loved the build quality of Razer, and the performance of Alienware, but both brands seem to only do one thing well, they're not necessarily an ""all around performer"". The razer blade is very MacBook like, but because of the Unibody design, TDP power limits are reduced to keep temperatures under control. Alienware build quality is nice, but they care very little about thermals and just wind the fans to oblivion to achieve the highest performance possible. Lenovo is not only a great computer to use on a daily basis, but under intense gaming, the fans are at a reasonable volume, while delivering very high end performance. the 165hz QHD display is night and day difference compared to my last 1080p panel. the colors are crisp and vibrant, and I really enjoy looking at it. Lenovo keyboards are easily the best on the market. Number pads are a must for me, so when I find laptops i like that do not have one, its an utter disappointment. The only downside to this computer would be the 300w power brick. its not the bulkiest one ive ever used, but its up there. to eliminate the really thick power bricks needed to run a 3070 gpu, Lenovo has opted to make the power brick thinner, but large in length and width. I prefer this size over a thicker power brick because it still fits easily in the ThinkPad neoprene soft case i like using with Lenovo Legion's.

B09NS2SMKP,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,7 September 2022,the United States,False,"Disclaimer, I’ve been into games my whole life, but I’m not your average gamer. Not knowledgeable on computer specs whatsoever. So recently, I bought this laptop (around July 2022) after extensive looking for a laptop that I could use for school and gaming. My brother actually helped me find this one so props to him.

I honestly believe this laptop is wonderful.
The screen display is very vibrant.
Runs very smoothly when it runs big games like Genshin.
Thankful it turns on & loads up fast. Man, my old laptop took 30 years to power up.
Yes, it comes with a huge 300w battery and also yes, the laptop itself doesn’t last very long off the battery. But that’s a fault you will have in any laptop with so much going on.
It’s not loud (meaning you can’t hear the fans), I’ve had it running all day once and it stays quiet the whole time.
The speakers are really good, they can get super loud if you want it.
I have not tested out the webcam, but research says the quality of the webcam is actually really nice. Also Comes with an off switch for your webcam.
The keys are pretty nice. And the back light comes in a wave of a nice rainbow color. I’m pretty sure you can customize it too. (I haven’t done so)
The mousepad on the Laptop is shifted towards the left a little bit. But it doesn’t bother me because I knew before purchasing it.
The screen is beautifully huge.
And wow all the USB ports all plug in the back.
With a couple more on the side for any easy access.
I have a very demanding job and I haven’t struggled with the stated weight & I take it everywhere with me in my book bag.

The only con I have with this is that the power plug that goes into the battery, comes apart so easily, you definitely will have to have the battery not hanging or dangling and will have to remain on a flat surface so the plug won’t come undone. Maybe it’s just a common laptop user habit I shouldn’t be dangling any cords. But I think cords connected to a 300w battery shouldn’t come undone so easily.

Other than that I’m happy with my purchase, and I would recommend this to any friends and family. It’s what I wanted and it was easily paid off.

Please always do your research before buying any appliance. For me to decide I did a ton of research between two other laptops I had in mind and this one. Thank you!

This laptop runs mean and it can definitely show for it.

Overall, this device is fantastic, and certainly offers a great alternative to using my Android smartphone for emails and internet browsing; handles Microsoft Office and Adobe products with ease and aplomb also. Windows 11 upgrade arrived about 2 weeks after I set the computer up -- have not had any problems using that OS since installing it then.

By no means am I a hardcore user, but it's nice to know that I have the gigs and the vid quality in the chamber, so to speak, if and when needed. Price keeps fluctuating here, so that might be a minor deterrent along with the relatively poor lighting on the screen (my 5500 is much brighter, and it's a 2019).

B09KWGHCLK,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,12 April 2023,the United States,False,"The ""Used - Good Condition"" purchase option was a real winner for me. It arrived flawless. No scratches. No scuffs. No marks whatsoever. Came in a factory Lenovo box with all the normal packaging and factory power supply.

It's very lightweight. The screen is fantastic. The touchscreen works. It *does* have a backlight keyboard (FN-Spacebar to toggle on/off).

Mine has Windows 11 Home in it in S-Mode. In the box are instructions to get it into normal Windows mode.

After initial setup and the million Windows updates to install, I used the Lenovo assistant app to update the system bios. For whatever reason, bios update aren't available through the normal Windows Update mechanism.

All that works

I debloated all the telemetry and such (search the Internet for Debloat Windows 11 and use the first GitHub link and PowerShell). Then I uninstalled all the preinstalled apps like Instagram and Spotify and The XBox Bar, etc.

Then I shrunk the windows partition to make room to install Linux. I use Fedora, but any modern Linux should work. No surprises. Hardware drivers were all in the default repos. (The machine has an Intel WiFi 6 card and Realtek audio.)

It's a great inexpensive machine with a 1080p touchscreen display and backlight keyboard, especially at the ""Used - Good Condition"" price.

HOWEVER, it has only 12GB RAM and *cannot be upgraded* (according to Lenovo's website). 4GB is soldered to the board. 8GB is in a traditional laptop DIMM slot (according to disassembly videos on YT). There is only a single slot. I don't know why it can't support a larger DIMM - I haven't tried to put a larger one in there.

There is a setting in the bios to make them function keys work normally (out of the box you need to press FN-F1 to get F1, etc. Otherwise you get the multimedia shortcut (volume mute in this example).

To boot from a USB, hold F12 when booting and select your USB device from the text menu. To enter the bios, press F2 (or possibly DEL) when booting.

I'm replacing a heavy, 9yr-old, flakey 17"" HP, 900p. So I'm thrilled with how much lighter, cooler, and quieter this Lenovo is.

Plus, it runs Linux without a hassle. No driver issues. Trackpad, WiFi, BT, and touchscreen all ""just work™"".

The rtx 3050ti is only 4gb which is not good if you aiming for 1080p gaming at medium or high settings. It will play but fps will be low and might drop significantly at times. Most modern triple A titles need at least 8gb vram. I mostly play league now, no problem there at all ofc. The 5600h igpu is good enough for esport titles. The graphics is switchable in bios.

I recommend maxing out the ram to 32gb. Ram is relatively cheap these days, ddr4 in particularly. The 8gb can work in everyday life cases but then no point in getting a laptop with 5600h and a dedicated gpu. I did upgrade it to 16gb which worked but I noticed a bit of bottleneck when doing intense work in adobe illustrator. So not too long ago upgraded to 32gb ddr4 ram.

B09KL954CC,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,23 May 2023,the United States,False,"I have chosen Asus Zenbook laptops for many years and this model met my expectations.
It may not be the most suitable for games, but I use it for office work, for statistical analysis and for simulation of medium-sized dynamic systems.
The OLED screen is excellent, although it's not touch sensitive (I used to buy that kind of screen before, but I found that I rarely used it).
The Zenbooks' keyboard has been greatly improved, and this model adds an optional number pad on its mouse pad.
The processor is an 11th generation Intel Evo i7-1165G7. It's not the fastest on the market, but pretty good for a laptop.
It's unfortunate that the RAM comes soldered on, although various sizes are available. I chose an 8GB model because I don't play heavy graphics or games, but sometimes when using Linux on a virtual machine, I think I would have been better off going with a 16GB option.
I found the original 512 GB SSD relatively slow and small. I decided to replace it with a 2TB SSD and chose a 4th generation Western Digital Black SN770. The speed of the equipment has improved, although it cannot take advantage of the full speed of this SSD (5150 MBps). However, the price is about the same as third-generation SSDs of the same size.
I have not observed any abnormal overheating of the computer with the new SSD, even during very disk intensive applications.
The two USB-C ports (Thunderbolt 4 type) are fast, although I've never achieved their maximum transmission speeds, not even to external Sata III drives. It also has a traditional USB-3 port and a microSD reader, but the latter is slow.
The device's camera, while better than previous Zenbook models, is still lacking, barely adequate for video conferencing.
Wi-Fi connections have worked perfectly.
The battery usually lasts for about 7 hours of normal activity. The Asus application that limits the charge when plugged in is really convenient and I hope that it will extend the battery life.
In summary: a highly recommended laptop that, for size and weight, I think is among the best laptops available at a mid-price.

Next, the keyboard types 2 of each letter when you are in certain programs.Next, sometimes it doesn't boot up when you start it, and you get a fuzzy screen.

Here are some of the things I love about this laptop:

Performance: The 11th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM make this laptop handle tasks with ease and I haven't noticed any slowdowns when browsing the web or downloading and installing files.. It can handle most demanding tasks, from multitasking to video editing.

Display: The 15.6-inch Full HD IPS display is crisp and clear, with excellent viewing angles. It's perfect for watching movies, working on documents, and browsing the web. I even found myself dimming the brightness to 20% because the brightness makes colors so vibrant and saturated.

Battery life: The battery life on this laptop is excellent. I can easily get a full day of use on a single charge.

Portability: The Aspire 5 is a relatively thin and light laptop, making it easy to carry around with you.
Price: The price of this laptop is very reasonable, especially considering its features and performance.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-702V. It's a great value laptop for students and anyone looking for a budget-friendly laptop with stellar performance.

B09J5FQ4P5,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,2 June 2022,the United States,False,"So we just got this laptop a couple days ago, and I'll update things as they go along. Firstly it's a pretty decent laptop for the money, trying to read reviews on it is a pretty mixed basket because they have so many other cheap/er laptops that most of the reviews are not for this one. So you'll have to pay attention to the model number they are reviewing. (Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-702V)
Here's a couple of my deciding points which lead to the purchase:

- Aluminum case (not super thick but still not plastic) has a more sturdy feel to it (within reason as this is not a $2K laptop).

- Solid Intel i7 Processor, first came to market Sep 2020. Good sized cache.

- It has a 512GB NVMe SSD drive in it which is the M.2 format, these are some of the fastest drives out right now as far as standards go. Most laptops with SSD are taking about the SATA drives, which while fast, are not anywhere close to the M.2 speeds.

- Being that it's an M.2 drive this leaves an entire drive bay empty in the laptop for future storage upgrade (SATA) if needed or having an alternate backup drive right in the laptop etc. (i.e. expandable in the future if you need it)

- It has 16GB of memory, I'm not sure why so many laptops out there only have 8GB, just running basic windows will eat at least 5GB+ of memory which doesn't leave a lot left for everything else. (In my humble opinion) and I appreciated the ability to upgrade that further in the future if needed to 24GB.

- It has plenty of USB ports and HDMI out for conference rooms/TV's etc.

Some of the cons:
- The power adapter is a very small ""pin"" power adapter. Needless to say this was rather disappointing because we all know that sometimes cords get pulled or bumped etc. And it's likely to damage the internals because it's very small. I would have liked to see one of the thicker power adapter connections just for strength.
- Windows 11 - Personally I'm not a huge fan thus far but mainly just for functionality reasons like you can't ungroup open programs on the task bar, it's one icon and that's it with no ability to change it. It's not a tablet it's a computer.
- No Thunderbolt Port
- No option to charge via USB C (which would negate the very tiny pin adapter)

So we did run into a couple issues. We had a problem with the laptop not seeing the power cord plugged in, it would blink as if it was going to start working (windows battery page in settings) then act like it was never plugged in. We reached out to Acer and they had us reset the battery via a paperclip and pin hole on the bottom. It's worked find so far after that. Getting a tech on the online chat via Acer support was fast and he was able to quickly resolve the issue.

So generally, this being my very first Acer Laptop, I'm pleased with things so far. We'll see how it holds up in the long run.

Update: DO NOT ORDER THIS WITH WINDOWS 11 INSTALLED.

I'm sorry m$oft that the OS needs a GPU to run taking away resources like that for other things. AMD does a better job processing video on Windows 10. I tried doing video editing on Windows 11 as is and it was garbage. Made my computer operate like a cheap paperweight computer. On Windows 10, you'll feel the difference immediately.

I like that laptop. Also, to save you time, if you're planning on upgrading the HDD, then remove temporarily the Wiresless LAN card that's inside so that you can insert the HDD wire completely and easily without breaking the laptop. Then you will be happy and save frustration.

It runs like garbage once you have Windows 11 running. (Of course we knew it would) I accidentally ordered the wrong operating system with it. On windows 10, it feels like a great computer.

B09HX29TPY,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,21 April 2025,the United States,False,"Overall this is a nice small, light, and cheap Windows laptop. A little slow, but acceptable for light use such as web browsing, email, listening to music on headphones, etc. It has Bluetooth and USB jacks for expansion, however you CANNOT UPGRADE THE RAM OR SSD. You're stuck with 4GB RAM, which is kind of small. Nevertheless, it runs Windows 11 Home edition at acceptable speed considering the price.

Hardware:
When closed it is smaller than an 8.5 by 11 sheet of paper. The 11.6"" screen is fine, but if you're planning on doing anything graphics intensive like gaming, this machine won't cut it. The keyboard feels small but OK. If you do a lot of typing you may want something better. The trackpad is OK. It can be turned into a number pad, which I have no use for. It has Bluetooth, which I use to add a ""normal"" mouse and wireless headphones. The battery last for many hours.

The RAM is permanently soldered onto the motherboard, so you're stuck with the 4gb that it comes with. Same story with the SSD. It comes with a 128gb SSD. You can expand the storage with a USB flash drive. There are 3 USB ports: 1 USB C, 1 SuperSpeed USB A, 1 slower USB A. The power adaptor uses a separate jack and does not use up the USB C port. There is one hdmi port, and a headphone jack. That's it for ports. There is no SD card slot.

Software:
It comes with Windows 11 home edition in ""S mode"". ""S mode"" means you can only install software through the Microsoft Store. However, it is pretty straightforward to break it out of ""S mode"" so you can install whatever software you want. There is not much bloatware from Asus. It also comes with a free 1 year subscription to Microsoft Office 365, which is nice. You'll probably want to install a music player app (Pandora, Spotify, VLC, etc). Maybe add your favorite antivirus program (unless you're satisfied with Windows Defender).

Summary:
For the money this is a good little Windows laptop. It's highly portable. It has Bluetooth and USB for expansion, but it's limited to 4gb RAM and it runs a little slow. If you're patient and not too demanding then you'll probably like it.

This laptop took three weeks to arrive. I ordered on the 1st November and the laptop came during the 21st November.

Thank you HoMei. I'm very happy with my new laptop. The seller was very paiteint when I panicked I'd ordered the wrong laptop, and asked to cancel, but then they assured me when I apologized that it was the right one I ordered. I was grateful for this service.

Thank you.
Would defiantly buy again if I ever needed to.

After using this laptop for a good few weeks, I can greatly say, this laptop is amazing with it's mediocre specs and great, affordable price.

Laptop comes as it says, although doesn't have an optical drive due to two fans to help cool the CPU while gaming.

CD Disc Drive: doesn't have an optical drive due to two fans to help cool the CPU while gaming.
Works brilliantly with an external disc drive.

Ram: Ram is only 4gb but runs games at ample speeds, without use of mods. I easily, was able to upgrade my ram to 16gbs, and my laptop now runs very smoothly.

Games it plays:

Minecraft
Sims 3 with all expansions and loads with mods almost instantly. with 16gbs ram on high settings
Star Stable

Runs multiple programs at once. Including recording software such as OBS (Open broad cast software)

CPU (THE CPU is an excellent spec for this laptop. Helps run all games smoothly.

Drive: Comes with HDD hard drive.

This laptop is suitable for extensive and heavy gaming.

Fans: The laptop fans can get a little noisy when running heavy programs or games, but nothing to drastic.

Upgrading: This laptop is simple enough to upgrade if you wanted to do it yourself. I have learning difficulties and was easy enough for me to work out without a manual, although I did do my homework before upgrading of course.
Only thing I'd mention is the screws were a little tight fitted on mine but was able to loosen them with a grip screwdriver.

Only thing I'd mention is the screws were a little tight fitted on mine but was able to loosen them with a grip screwdriver.

I'm very happy with this laptop. I was a bit skeptical buying overseas, especially with it being so little price for great specs. I have to say, I'm very impressed.

Only thing to watch out for is FedEx may charge a little extra for service which is understandable.

This laptop took three weeks to arrive. I ordered on the 1st November and the laptop came during the 21st November.

Thank you HoMei. I'm very happy with my new laptop. The seller was very paiteint when I panicked I'd ordered the wrong laptop, and asked to cancel, but then they assured me when I apologized that it was the right one I ordered. I was grateful for this service.

Thank you.
Would defiantly buy again if I ever needed to.

Para trabajo y estudio es mas que excelente y sobrado, si te importa el peso, esta no es para ti, yo con todo gusto cargo esta laptop valorando sus capacidades. Si quieres una laptop que te dure la batería todo el día, búscate una laptop no gamer.
Para juegos es una maquina que no esperaba que fuera tan potente, y no esperaba que viniera con una RTX 3060 de 130w, ... feliz! La calidad de pantalla y el brillo es excelente aunque sea de 250 nits, son suficientes para que te duelan los ojos de la intensidad del brillo. Uso el brillo en 50% y es mas intenso que una laptop de bajo precio con brillo al maximo.
Es el equipo mas económico con Hybrid/Optimus (switch MUX), y es una gran ventaja para sacar todo el potencial de la RTX 3060 (15-20 fps adicionales con Optimus en Off), esta característica era importante para mi porque puedo tener toda la potencia de la gpu en la pantalla del mismo equipo y no depender de una pantalla externa para saber su verdadera capacidad.
La batería en optimus para ofimática y vídeos dura aproximadamente 3 horas y 45 minutos.
La refrigeración me parece muy funcional y muy silenciosa, con 4 salidas (2 laterales y 2 traseras) y 2 entradas amplias (por la parte de abajo y la parte superior, entre el teclado y la pantalla), recomiendo utilizar una muy buena base de refrigeración adicional para darle vida en el tiempo y cuidar tu inversión.
La tecla G activa la máxima velocidad de los ventiladores (para nada molestos) así como el brillo pero aun no he verificado si las frecuencias de la cpu o gpu suben, pero sin activar la tecla G es lo suficientemente potente para correr tus juegos en máxima calidad sin contratiempos.
Sobre el acabado, es de plástico, pero en mi opinión personal es plástico de muy buena calidad, excelente ensamble, muy solida por todos lados, fuerte, resistente y muy buen acabado. No es una laptop con diseño excesivo gamer, pero es diferente a una laptop común, discreta pero con un toque especial, sobrio y elegante.
Viene con Windows 11 para inicializar, que me parece mucho mejor que con windows 10 actualizable y tener problemas de drivers luego.

En resumen, encontré todas las características que buscaba por el dinero que pensaba invertir, hasta el momento cero fallas, gran potencia para juegos actuales. Si falla, actualizare este comentario.

I’m not sure if something is corrupted or if there’s a problem with windows but after the crash it performed an auto reset. Now the laptop is stuck in a reset loop, installs to 63% resets, rinse and repeat. Tried safe boot/startup, can’t. Tried shift F10 method. Nothing. Don’t know what to do.

Edit: my friend who is very computer savvy fixed my laptop back to its out of the box state. Turns out Windows 11 had crashed and caused the reboot loop. I am changing my review to 5 stars after realizing it was a windows error not the laptop hardware itself. After reinstalling all the proper drivers, it is back up to standard.

The laptop itself runs very nice, I can play 95% of my steam library on max/high graphics and I don’t feel the laptop overheating or slowing down. I always play plugged in. Forza Horizon 4, Tarkov and Elden Ring are the only three games at the moment that I have to lower the resolution on to play at a smooth 60+ fps. But once I hit 60fps the games feel great and play well.

The keyboard feels nice. Occasionally it will not pickup a key that I press while typing, but it doesn’t happen often enough to warrant a low rating.
Screen brightness is nice and vibrant, RGB keys look great and can be customized.

Speakers are little bit on the quiet side, but with 3 USB ports and a headphone jack this problem is easily solved.

Would definitely recommend Asus as a brand. My only regret with this laptop is not spending the extra money to get a better model. 9/10

Bluetooth not turning on, WiFi dropping, that were solved with updates.
Ok, now on to gaming; it works amazingly!
In DotA2, I can see the grass moving in the wind as I get ganked.
In Civilization 6 I can see the fish and crabs on the coast as Barbarians pillage my fishing boats.
In Halo 4 I can see the expression on that Elite's face as he bitch slaps the life out of me.

The build quality is great as well. Despite it being mostly plastic, it's solid and has a quality feel to it, if not premium. The keyboard & track pad are nice to use. The battery is enough for casual use when I need something portable

The issues I have are to do with connectivity and the awful RGB features. The wifi card needs to be disabled and enabled almost every time I wake it up from sleep mode or power it on. It just stops working. Additionally, bluetooth devices take a while to connect when waking up & powering on also.

Also, when in sleep, the laptop's RGB lighting goes into some kind of demo mode after a while, and it lights up my whole room which wakes me up. One of the LEDs on the bottom of the case now flashes random colors unless I set everything to the color red. This is annoying, and the software that manages it is some of the worst bloatware I've ever encountered, and it's near impossible to uninstall it without running a utility from ASUS's website.

All that said, I love this computer a lot and use it every day. lol

I wanted to share my experience with the Lenovo laptop, having previously used an HP Elitebook that was very sleek, light, and attractive (which I loved). While Lenovo's products are generally cheaper than other brands, this may also reflect their performance.

Although this laptop's camera quality and fingerprint reader are subpar, there are also some positives. Firstly, the display is slightly bigger than the HP Elitebook, which is a plus. Secondly, the display of the Lenovo doesn't bother me as it did with the HP( reflections were a bit more noticeable on HP displays). Finally, the laptop is incredibly affordable for its specifications, even more so than the HP.

Moreover, the integrated stylus pen is a bonus that is handy for me. However, I want to mention that I've experienced some stalling with the laptop, especially after installing Windows 11, which was disappointing.

While the Lenovo laptop isn't perfect, it's a decent option if you're on a budget and looking for a notebook with a larger display, more RAM, and an integrated stylus pen.",0

Just an up front warning, out of the box no WiFi. Just an ethernet RJ-45 jack.
No problem for me as it's a desktop replacement so I'm always jacked in via RJ-45 and always plugged in.

My 17inch HP Envy no longer powers up.
My backup 17inch HP Pavilion powers up but you can fry an egg on top of it.
Decided that I'm finished with HP and especially their over heating issues.

That was a great decision - this Thinkbook P17 is really nice.
The ""Lenovo Vantage"" website made it easy to update the BIOS and every other driver.
It's a quality build, the screen is great and the keyboard (backlit) is excellent. It runs super quiet - a big plus.
It has two Thunderbolt 4 ports in back - fast. I made a Acasis TBU405/Samsung 990 EVO Plus SSD drive.
This Lenovo makes me regret all the issues I put up with in my HP's.
Ordered from LittlePiggy_Tech and it arrived new in box as described.
Only issue was it arrived (in 2 days) packed with the manufacturer's box inside a plain shipping box with zero padding or cushioning.

Now that it's updated and I've assured it is the exact build as advertised (with Speccy) I can't wait to blow windows away and install Linux Mint.
This is beginning to look like the best laptop I ever bought.

UPDATE March 29, 2025 Thinkpad P17 Gen 2 ****** 6 stars

This is the sweetest laptop i've ever used.
It's running Linux Mint flawlessly. It's fast and quiet.

B09CSQP1FN,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,14 November 2022,the United States,False,"I definitely like the computer in spirit, and in build quality. The keyboard is the best I've ever had in a laptop and good for my larger hand size, it performs well in multiprocessor scenarios for building software. I knew it was going to be an odd brick of a machine with limited portability, but felt I could deal with that. I even chose a cheap screen option because I never touch the screen of laptops...and my vision isn't great so it's not like I care that much for the ""retina"" displays.

What I did not think about is that even if you don't care about touch facilities, the older IPS panels are not reinforced like what we're used to from cell phones or tablets. If you aren't careful, even a small bump from a stray cable in your laptop bag can damage the screen. My last two computers have been hybrid tablets (surface book, lenovo yoga) and I got used to just throwing them in the bag with cables and not thinking much of it. But a very minor touch from a cable that I didn't even imagine could have hurt the screen (thought nothing of it when it happened, did not make any physical mark on the screen) turned out to damage this P17 and I had to send it in for repair.

Second caution I'd give is that the big bulky mechanical nature of this laptop comes with a warning: there are big mechanical fans inside that spin up when you're doing anything (including watching youtube, that is all it takes), and they can rattle if misaligned. These have started doing that a bit, and I guess I have to decide when it bothers me enough to send it in. It's at the barely tolerable level right now, and hopefully it won't get worse.

From the size alone, it's definitely not a computer for everybody. And if you're going to buy this machine, be sure to get an extended warranty because there's a lot of moving parts that can go wrong. If I could do it again I would probably get something with no moving parts and a tougher screen, and offload compute to the cloud or like a mac-mini or Volterra type external brick, vs. try to put it all into one package.

The computer was a refurbished but came packaged brand new. All parts were in the package and the laptop had no visual defects and no technical problems. I would Highly recommend this computer for moderate gaming, business and studies. To go in more depth continue reading the keys highlights.

Screen quality: very nice and sturdy, limited flex kept me reassured it wouldn't snap when opening and closing.

Keyboard: although the keyboard is nothing special it by no means under performed and kept me wanting. It did what it had to and suffices for the work we needed done.

Performance: the laptop performed over my expectations. It runs very smooth, boot times are snappy. The programs don't stutter and there is very low delay on Windows built in applications which I consider a significant sign of good processing power. Compared to other laptops equiped with a similar processor I did not notice significant differences compared to similar laptops. The ram is adequate for school and business purposes. I didn't find the laptop to get hot very quickly.

Touchpad: nothing to say here really the touchpad performs well it does what it's required the presses were responsive and it doesn't feel flimsy when being pushed down

Gaming: I gave this laptop a but of a stress test running games (Grand theft auto V, Sims 4, modded Minecraft) the laptop performed above my expectations in this field although lacking a dedicated graphics card; the on-board built in ryzen chip graphics did exceptionally well and was some of the reason I opted for this chipset. One must keep in mind this laptop is not geared towards gaming and is not built with it in mind. That being said this laptop gave me consistent framerates is GTA V between 45-60 frames averaging at around 45 on medium settings and when driving fast and loading parts of the map rapidly it did sometimes dip to the 30's but that's to be expected so very capable machine, in moderately modded Minecraft (between 120-150 mods) with maxed at settings and the performance mods (such as optifine and sodium) things you would have installed normally if you play modded Minecraft, we recieved a solid 70-80 frames consistently and sometimes going above that peaking at around 100. With the addition of ""shaders"" (a lighting/graphical overhaul for the game making it significantly more intense on the computer) it averaged around 45 frames with minimal stutters occasionally dipping to the 30's if loading in new areas quickly. All-in-all the laptop performed very well in these tests and I'm sure it could run older games and most newer games on medium to low settings.

Brightness: the laptop did take a slight hit here I believe it could have been brighter but it's brightness was acceptable in well lit rooms and the screen was still usable.

Noise: I believe the laptop was not very loud in standard applications and normal studies. When games and more heavy programs were running though the laptops fans kicked into high gear and the sound was noticable but again it's not built for gaming so it's expected to do what it can to keep itleslf running optimally. So if you can deal with some fan noise I think this laptop is absolutely amazing. In normal use for browsing the web and using light applications you will not notice the fan noise very much if at all.

Ram: I think 12gb is more than enough for normal business and and educational use. I think for gaming is does work but I would have loved to see an extra 4gb installed, but that being said, I do believe this laptop is upgradable and I will look into it in the coming months and will update my review with what I find.

Overall this laptop is exceptional for the price providing you with a good processor and adequate ram. It performs very well and is a great laptop for a college student and someone who does alot of work on business work, as well as performs above my expectations in light to moderate gaming! This one is definitely a YES for me and I would recommend it to anyone I need of something very capable. If it is every on sale grab it! You won't be disappointed especially at a discounted price.

B09BMGCVZH,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,9 December 2021,Singapore,False,"Pros:
For the price paid, the CPU is cutting edge and performs very well.
I'm not too particular about screens and colour accuracy, so as long as it's bright enough and the colours look like what they're supposed to be, I'm ok with it.
Upgrading is easy enough, but there is a pretty big downside to it.

Con: (just one, so far)
The plastic bezel that made up the entire bottom case, was made of softer plastic - after carefully opening the cover to upgrade the RAM and SSD, the notches became visibly deformed, and it could be seen through the gaps from the top. Whether this is a ""design"" to make opening leave telltale signs, I don't know, but using soft plastic for this unibody design is just meh. However, this is not a problem if you do not intend to perform upgrades and just use the included 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD.",0

B09BGB358R,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,30 May 2022,the United States,False,Mainly bought this for online classes and to run data analysis software on it. Works great! Screen is a little on the cheaper side (its one of those screens you have to tilt back to get a decent viewing angle) but its not really a concern for the purpose i use it for. I purchased the 17in model so the screen is large and works great with multiple open windows. Keyboard feels a little weird not much travel to the keys but again not a big concern. Don’t really game on it but I did download a few STEAM games and they worked and ran great. The processor handles them no problem. Mine came with WINDOWS 11 which I have grown to like (great multi-tasking features!) I think it’s a great mid-range laptop that’s great for students and office work. Might be a good choice for casual/amateur gamers that want to get into gaming without paying $1200+ but definitely invest in a keyboard and mouse if you’re trying to be serious about your gaming.

B09BDFTX65,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,6 January 2022,Mexico,False,"Me encantó el producto, definitivamente es una excelente compra y les haré un listado de las cosas buenas y las pocas cosas malas de la Laptop.

Cosas buenas:
-Es la opción más barata en la gama gaming de todas las marcas, todas las demás opciones están arriba de 900 USD.
-El combo con el procesador Ryzen y la GTX 1650 es perfecto, no existe ningún cuello de botella en ningún proceso.
-La pantalla es increíble, aunque el brillo no es sobresaliente, esos 120 Hz son espectaculares, se nota muchísimo la fluidez en los juegos.
-Y hablando de juegos, está laptop puede con todo, con juegos light como CSGO, Valorant, Minecraft y Euro Truck Simulator (por dar algunos ejemplos) en gráficos altos va fluido a 120 fps o incluso hasta más fps; en juegos más actuales como Halo Infinite puede ir a 60 fps en gráficos medios. Siempre y cuando tengas una configuración correcta en el panel de control de Nvidia. (Nota: yo le hice un pequeño overclock a la gráfica con GeForce Expirience)
-Las temperaturas son normales (no más de 75°C) incluso en juegos exigentes como Halo Infinite.
-Los gráficos integrados del procesador son tan potentes que pueden con un fondo de pantalla animado en FHD a 120 fps.
-La SSD que carga está laptop es rapidísima, tiene 1800 MB de lectura y 1200 MB de escritura.
-El teclado se siente de excelente calidad y su retroiluminación es perfecta.
-La calidad de la carcasa de la Laptop es muy buena por el precio, no se siente en ningún momento algún plástico barato o de mala calidad.

Cosas malas:
-La batería dura poco, aproximadamente 2 horas en configuración de máximo rendimiento y 3 horas y media en configuración de ahorro de bateria; pero sin embargo es de esperarse ya que es un equipo gaming.
-La RAM que viene es insuficiente para juegos, ya que 2 GB se comparten con la tarjeta gráfica integrada del procesador, sin embargo esto se soluciona poniéndole un módulo extra de 8GB para activar el dual-channel, que es lo que yo hice, y por cierto, es recomendadísimo hacerlo ya que su rendimiento aumenta al hacer esto.
-Windows 11 sigue teniendo algunos errores y Bugs importantes, así que por el momento es recomendable tener Windows 10.

Y estos son los puntos a favor y en contra de la laptop, en general solo existe una cosa ""mala"" en la laptop, ya que las otras dos tienen una solución muy sencilla. Pero en general estoy muy contento con la compra, no me arrepiento de nada.

B09BDFTX65,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,21 August 2024,the United States,False,"I bought this laptop in 2022 and boy was it the best $600 I've ever spent, granted the GPU on here isn't all that powerful, but honestly it has carried be pretty far for a MOBILE GPU! Seriously, it's been good to me these past two years.

*I would highly recommend upgrading the ram and storage with another SSD if you can, and honestly it felt like that's the assumption it was made with. The 8gb ram and pitiful but fast 512gb storage is just not enough now.

* Airflow is surprisingly good and temps don't get out of hand, though do keep in mind this is a laptop, and it will get loud when seriously gaming.

* I'm not a big RGB person, but I REALLY appreciate the simple white backlit keyboard, especially when working at night or in poorly lit environments.

* I ESPECIALLY LIKE the secondary function keys and I love how they can be toggled with FnLock function key. I love this feature so much that looking for a desktop version of it for my incoming PC, and even willing to get it custom-made if I have to. I was NOT expecting to love the keyboard as much as I do, but it's so useful.

This thing has carried me through classes, gaming sessions and is great to connect your TV to with HDMI, and has been so versatile and useful I can't think of how I would have managed without it. But it's a stop gap for me till I have enough to put a good gaming pc together, and yes the BATTERY IS AN ISSUE, it's simply too small and dies fast. But by no means am I downplaying this little monster, if you have the money, need something mobile for work, and gaming and there's no alternative with a bigger battery I would highly recommend.

*also GET A WIRELESS MOUSE, TRUST ME YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!

B09BDFTX65,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,26 April 2022,Mexico,False,"Es un equipo bastante potente, corre varios juegos a 70 fps y los menos exigentes se ven geniales a los 120 FPS que puede mostrar la pantalla. Los colores no son los mejores, pero para juegos están excelentes, lo suficientemente saturados y tiene muy buen contraste y ángulos de visión. Es verdad que solo se cuenta con 6 GB de RAM porque 2 están ya reservados para la Radeon, pero el slot adicional lo resuelve todo, igual con el almacenamiento, esa parte se puede aprovechar muy bien para aumentar a tu gusto la capacidad del equipo. En cuanto a la batería sí dura poco, he llegado a conseguir hasta 4 horas con los ventiladores y la configuración de Windows en modo de eficiencia energética con tareas sencillas como navegar, ver algunos videos en FHD, escribir documentos y leer, pero es todo, no da mucho más, así que está entre 2.5 y 4 horas su duración dependiendo el uso y brillo de la pantalla. En mi caso no me afecta tanto porque acostumbro usar el equipo conectado en el escritorio, y tiene un modo de conservación que mantiene la carga hasta el 60% para no estresar la batería y alargar su vida útil, pero debes considerarlo si necesitas transportar mucho la computadora y usarla en lugares de difícil acceso a energía. El teclado es demasiado bueno, se siente muy bien al escribir y jugar, y su retroiluminación es excelente para trabajar en lugares con poca luz. En general es un excelente equipo, cumple con lo que necesito como Artista Digital y me sirve de sobra para jugar. Por último, y si de algo sirve, soy de Guanajuato y me llegó aproximadamente en 5 días, un día antes de lo que indicaba el rastreo del producto, pero supongo que depende mucho del estado y también de la zona.

B09BDFTX65,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,3 February 2022,the United States,False,"Quality feel, responsive and easy to upgrade. I don't play a lot of demanding titles, but this pc preforms well in games like WOW, Minecraft Dungeons, ESO and Genshin. It works nicely for office work and other media consumption as well.

Pros:

Keyboard has a nice tactile response, and the typing experience is enjoyable even if a little truncated. That is to say that the 10 key (numbers pad) is a bit on the smaller side. It feels natural after a few hours of typing. It is backlit which is also nice.

The screen, to me, is more than bright enough and the colors are vibrant. Not as good as my desktop monitor but way better than any of my budget media/office laptops.

It was very easy to upgrade as well. Included the bracket, connector, and screws to mount a 2.5 inch drive.

Cons:

There is a lack of ports, which I knew when I bought it and is not a deal breaker but is worth mentioning. Two usb a (3rd gen), one usb c (data only), an hdmi, a combo audio jack and a proprietary power port. A third usb a (even if only 2.0) would have been nice, on the opposing/lefthand side as would a car reader. I also don't understand the lack of usb c charging in this day and age but that seems to be a common issue with gaming laptops (at many price points) so I would hold that against it.

It did not include a standoff of adding a second M.2 NVME even though there is a slot for it. Not the end of the world but odd, nonetheless.

Battery life is nonexistent. 2-3 hours of mixed use and less than an hour when gaming.

Overall:

I must say that I am happy so far. As I said, it was easy to upgrade and is quite responsive both in office work and at gaming. If what you are looking for is portable gaming setup, this might be for you. Or you want to do some light media editing. It also does office/schoolwork and media consumption well, as it should. Makes a great alternative to trying to buy a graphics card for your desktop at the moment too.

Quality seems to be there; it is your use case that will decide if this pc is for you. Want a portable gaming setup that can do office/schoolwork, some light editing and media consumption? Then this might be for you. On the other hand, if you want a work/school pc that can game on the side I might look for something with good integrated graphics that is lighter and has better battery life. That call is going to be on you.

As long as you understand what you are buying, I think you will be happy with this laptop. I know I am.

As Amazon make returns almost impossible and I just cannot trust Amazon to resolve this, I will be upgrading the RAM and SSD through a registed Dell dealer here in the UAE. I should have gone to the same to make the purchase in the first place, but hey, everyone trusts Amazon right.

I was unfamiliar with but surprised by the size and weight. Not only that, it was damned easy to fire up and getting started. I was impressed with the ease of adapting to Chrome OS after decades of Windows. I don't even miss Windows now (I thought I would since I had a couple decades of using it). It is a highly intuitive system (MVHO). It also seems to do things I would do but I don't have to--the machine beats me to it!!

Startup is smooth and quick, the OS is installed on the 256GB SSD. This is ideal and perfect for fast boot times and prevents Windows processes from be interfered with by foreign applications and programs that may be running.

I immediately made a download folder on the 1TB HDD to make sure the SSD is dedicated to Windows to ensure a smooth experience.

Pros:
Fast boot (3-5 seconds because of the SSD)
Windows 10 (Let’s be honest, it’s still the best)
Intel Core i7 (Amazing CPU with overclock if needed)
1 TB HDD (perfect amount of xtra storage space)
Light weight (maybe 2.5-3lbs))
3x USB ports and 1x USB C port (great compatibility)
ASUS (Speaks for itself… clean..slick..it’s great)

Cons:
The only con I found is related to the speakers on the laptop. They’re weak and do not perform well when watching a video and/or stream that has a wide “dynamic-range” of audio. If someone is speaking too loudly or at a high pitch, it sounds scratchy. When this happens I end up having to turn the master volume down on the laptop to prevent it.

Besides the weak speakers, this is the perfect work laptop. I did not get this laptop to game or watch videos or stream. I got it for performance and it absolutely, if not excelled, my expectations.

I really like the backlit keyboard and the touchscreen. So far the computer is working great. I am using it mainly for word-processing work. Really nice keyboard in a nice slim chassis. Note that although this should be pretty easily portable, the battery life is not awesome (5-6 hours). For my use this doesn't matter, but for portability, I have a delightful 11-inch ASUS that gets 10-11 hours of battery life. This one is probably best for home use.",0

B099337FKM,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 May 2021,Canada,False,"I have use this laptop for couple days, there’s something I like and don’t like, first of all, it’s Really very good quality, feels much better than previous generation. I use it for gaming and video processing, it’s very high efficiency laptop for video processing and the noise is lower than MacBook Pro when rendering 4K video in premiere pro,
Rendering speed is way more faster than MacBook Pro 2018 with 16g RAM.

Cons: Keystone is not very well secured, easy to get lost. Cover material feels very good but it’s a Finger prints magnet, and not easy to clean up.

Expectation: If I have a choice of 4K monitor, it will be great. But in Canada, I can’t find that option anywhere.",0
B099337FKM,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,2 August 2022,the United States,False,"The good:
Great CPU/GPU performance even for the price.
The screen is bright and clear, glare isn't an issue.
Ungradable in terms of RAM and SDD storage.
Slim and lightweight but feels solid and high quality.
The fans are quiet under normal usage and not terrible under heavy gaming.

The bad:
The often mentioned ""clicky"" keyboard isn't for everyone.
The style, although the lights can be turned off or made more neutral isn't for everyone.
No camera.
The key thing is sort of odd.

The maybe good or bad depending on how you look at it:

You can't really get the full performance out of the 3080 without an external 4k monitor... However if you are using an external 4k monitor then you can get more performance.

Summary:

On the last note, everything looks and plays just great on the built-in screen. However it doesn't benchmark any better than 3060/3070. With a 4k screen though is a different story. Maybe something to keep in mind if you are only planning on using the built-in screen. (Which again looks great.)

Otherwise, it has been a solid and reliable laptop. I do gaming but also software development heavily using the GPU. I think the lack of a camera is the only sort of inconvenient thing.

B099337FKM,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 July 2021,Canada,False,"If you're looking at a 3080 laptop, it means you need it because you're a gamer, or you have too much money and wanted to splurge. If you need a laptop for work, your 60 year old co-worker will sweetly ask you what games you play. If you need a laptop for content creation, go with with a QHD laptop. If you need a laptop for mining, stop reading and go re-evaluate your life.

Know what you're not getting:
- you're not getting a webcam/mic
- you're not getting a quiet system, not to say the fans are inadequate, but you should have headphone on for gaming anyway
- a 400 or 500 nits screen - it sits nicely indoors at 300 nits
- a lightweight laptop - do the research
- a thin laptop - again, no one should be surprised
- a CPU that's clocked to run hotter than the GPU sometimes

Know what you are getting:
- fast screen and response time - even everyday use is smooth compared to 120 and 144 hz. I have trouble seeing the difference between 240 hz and 300 hz
- excellent keyboard - it's not for everyone, but if you love mechanical keyboard and the satisfying clicks, you'll probably love this. Check out Linus' video on this laptop.
- top of time line specs - at least for the rest of 2021 and half of 2022, you're not going to need to upgrade
- a way to let everyone know your RBG game is on point, and that you're probably really sweaty
- very good speakers for a laptop
- a cooling system that you can customize in armour crate - #lifeprotip, cooling the CPU also cools the GPU

B099337FKM,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,10 February 2022,the United States,False,"I was in the market for a new laptop and knew I wanted something reasonably powerful with an AMD processor. This checked all the boxes and wasn't too heavy or big. I also knew I intended to upgrade the storage and memory straight away so I wasn't too picky about the M.2 or memory configuration.

That said 16GB of memory is solid for most things you can do although I have no idea about the timings it is running in dual channel so speed is optimized right out of the box. I purchased 64GB of Corsair Vengeance SODIMMs (2x32GB) with CL20 timing and they worked right out of the box with no issues whatsoever.

The disk space at 1TB isn't fantastic but most people could probably get by with this and be just fine, I produce music on the road and also play games to pass the time. I ended up purchasing two 2TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus NVMe drives and upgraded the C drive to 2TB and added a 2TB D drive as well. This isn't for the feint of heart as it requires you to reinstall Windows 10 and to reinstall all of the laptop specific/platform specific drivers. While it's not too hard, it's not a beginner friendly option. I can't comment on the performance between the stock NVMe drive and the replacements but I can say it boots insanely fast and run extremely well.

I also upgraded Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro with a legitimate pro key from Microsoft for $99 on their website. I know you can find cheaper keys but I really don't trust them and anyway $99 isn't soul crushingly expensive and I like the peace of mind I get knowing it's completely legitimate and I won't ever have any problems with it. This process was smooth and super easy and took all of 5 minutes to complete.

The keyboard on the laptop is probably the best laptop keyboard I've ever used, the key travel isn't much but it's tactile and a little clicky. I love mechanical keyboards so it's a nice touch here and the keyboard doesn't feel the least bit mushy like some laptop keyboards can be. I also must say the LEDs are bright and look fantastic. Though I can't help but feel Asus may have gone a little overboard with the RGB you can turn off unwanted RGB elements so I can't really complain about it and it looks amazing in the dark.

Laptop thickness and weight is just fine as well as the overall dimension of the laptop and it's not bad lugging through airports on using on planes. My previous laptop was a 17"" and I wasn't in love with the size or weight. 15.6"" seems spot on for a laptop you intend to take with you everywhere. It's also extremely solidly built, there's no creaking or weird sounds coming out of the mechanical bits of the chassis and the hinges on the screen are extremely supportive and when typing the screen isn't jiggling around. You put the screen up and it's rock solid and that is fantastic as far as I'm concerned. The numeric keypad on the mouse track pad seems OK but I haven't really used it for much but it does function well enough though it kind of feels ""gimmicky"" to me. My only hardware gripe is I wish it has a couple more USB ports but that's minor as you can easily add a hub. I haven't used a laptop with a ""mux"" (I think that's what it's called) switch but I like that the laptop uses the built in graphics when it doesn't need all the power of the 3080 which helps with heat and power. If it gives up a few frames in a game I'm personally OK with that sacrifice to get more time when on battery.

I can't comment on any bloatware that might come installed on the laptop as I removed the original 1TB NVMe m.2 drive before I even powered on the laptop and upgraded as stated above. I do however find Asus Armory Crate and Aura Creator lacking. The laptop stats screen is great and informative, but I feel the color settings are clunky and either lacking in much customization options, or overly complex in Aura Creator. With regards to Aura Creator it's apparently extremely buggy and I can't actually apply a custom created color which is annoying I get an error doing this. I don't like Armory Crate on my desktop and apart from the laptop stats page, I don't like it on my laptop either.

B0992VS1BY,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,24 April 2023,the United States,False,"I bought this laptop mainly for school but I wanted the ability to play some games it’s been rock solid. The performance is good not great but good. I was able to play hogwarts legacy on low graphics perfectly, Minecraft (Java) with mods was around 80fps with 12 render distance, dead space ran great at low with no noticeable lag, halo MCC ran flawlessly at any quality, hit man 3 ran great as well as Propnight at low.

Once you’re done gaming and you switch to the silent profile the battery life is amazing I’ll be at 50 percent but still have 4 hours before needing to charge. My only complaint is the speakers aren’t very loud and the fingerprint scanner doesn’t always work. The keys are backlit and you can change the colors but they aren’t individually addressable.

Over all I love this Laptop as long as you aren’t expecting it to replace your desktop you’ll love it set it to performance and low graphics and it’ll play anything. Need better battery life? Switch to the integrated graphics on the silent mode and you’ll have plenty of battery life.",0
B0992VS1BY,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,8 January 2025,the United States,False,"Purchased in March 2023. I do not run this machine very hard. I primarily use it for work and some occasional gaming in my downtime. I took this with me on a couple of work trips, and it will run all day on battery, just barely, doing light notetaking and running MS Office applications. Anything heavier and you will need to plugin after 5-6 hours.

You cannot run this machine with the lid closed while gaming or doing anything heavy. It will shutoff to prevent overheating. You have to open the lid slightly to allow the heat to escape through the keyboard area. If you are doing basic office work while multi-tasking (watching videos, listening to music, etc) then the lid can remain closed while running in low power mode with USB C power.

The Good: Good CPU, RTX 3080 plays most game titles well at 1080p (some at 1440p), I like the keyboard feel, no webcam (yes, I actually like this), runs 2 external displays + internal laptop screen, lots of ports, easy to open and upgrade/work on if needed, has extra NVME slot for additional storage, matte 1440p high refresh screen, portability is decent considering the amount of power it has, optional USB power when not running resource intensive tasks.

The Bad: Only one slot for RAM expansion (maxes out at 24GB), RAM from the factory is soldered, battery life could be better, noisy fans when running in performance mode when gaming, RGB turned on on keyboard by default, cannot run in clamshell mode when gaming, screen bezels are a bit chonky at the bottom.

It is thin, light, and you can charge it via USB-C this is a great laptop for gaming, and also for work while staying mobile. It will handle what you need it to.

B0992VS1BY,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,12 December 2022,the United States,False,"3 stars due to false advertised specifications.

First off, I purchased this for it's specs - expandable NVMe, expandable RAM - etc. When I went to install a 32gb SO-DIMM, the laptop wouldn't boot. so I replaced it with a known good DIMM (figuring maybe I got a DOA RAM stick) - same result.

Contacted ASUS and they informed me that the 40GB sepcification (which is on this model on Amazon, and also on the same model on the ASUS page, and in their user's manual) is a ""generalization for a many model, and is not correct for this one.""

Be forewarned, that with the onboard soldered RAM (8GB) this model is only expandable to 24GB total (with a 16GB expansion).

Very disappointed to learn that it is not advertised anywhere that this specific model has a 32GB max.

Other than the above, it works well. Performed a fresh install of the OS to remove bloatware and it runs great.

This would be a higher star review if the specifications were correct on any documentation/advertising.

B098JCH27M,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,6 January 2023,the United States,False,"This review is for the Acer 311 Chromebook, the 11.6 inch version. Most of the reviews listed are for the 15 inch Chromebook. This Chromebook is a great little device. I watch videos, read articles, check email, shop etc. Things that most everyone does when using a computer or tablet. I am not a gamer. Any game that I play are along the simpler side like a crossword puzzle, Bejeweled or some game that is linked to Facebook and I don't do that often. So if you are more of a gamer, you may want to get a higher tech Chromebook. But for most things this Chromebook is just fine. The keyboard is a standard size with the number pad being omitted on this laptop. That's okay because it's more like a standard old school typewriter and I actually like the feel of the keyboard better than I like my windows laptop. I find that this little Chromebook is snappier than my Windows laptop and boots up quick. My laptop is around a year or so old. I actually like the size of this device, even though my Windows laptop is 15 inches with a bigger screen, because is so portable and doesn't take up much space. One big advantage this has over my bigger laptop is the battery life. My windows laptop will not last more than 3 or 4 hours unplugged and this Chromebook will last over 50% longer before needing to be charged. I zoom in to enlarge the screen a little is something seems a little small, so no big deal as far as reading an article. I think this Chromebook would definitely be good for students. I am not a student. I decided to purchase this when I discovered my laptop didn't have bluetooth abilities. Windows 11, at times is frustrating to me with windows popping up when I was trying to read an article or watch a video when using a mouse. The finger track pad is good and responsive with adequate space, I just prefer a mouse when using it at table. For most things I do on the internet a Chromebook will suit me just fine and probably better. One thing I found frustrating when I was deciding on a Chromebook (this is my first one) was the omission of the AUE date of description of the listings. Wasn't sure when this one would expire, but decided to buy it anyway because of the size and the price. I snagged this in early January when the price was $99 dollars at the time of this review it is $138. I used a couple of giftcards and a fire tablet trade-in so my out of pocket was $25. Not bad and was the deciding factor when purchasing. At $138 it is still a good buy, but there may be some Chromebooks that have a longer AUE. The AUE for this Chromebook is June 2026. So if you are looking for updates for 5 years or more, you might want to keep looking. This is as mentioned in the listing a rugged little laptop and military grade which can withstand a splash of a spilled glass of water or a drop from a few feet. That would be a big plus if buying for a school aged child. The screen is not bad, sure there are other screens that are better, but this just fine with HD and I don't really notice when watching a movie or show, a whole lot of difference. For such an inexpensive device the storage is quite good. I have not put an SD card in it yet, but there is a slot for that. I like that there is more USB ports than the Samsung Chromebook 4 (which is another that I considered) since I like to use a mouse, sometimes an external non-bluetooth speaker, or just charge my phone while using it. All in all, I am happy with this Chromebook and would recommend to anyone looking for a very cheap device that does not feel or seem cheap.

I use this everyday from the time I get up until I go to bed which is more than 16 hours. When this one eventually wears out, I will definitely buy another HP.

Update: Oct 15, 2023
I just wanted to give an update to this. I am still so very pleased with this laptop. I'm still in awe of the speed in the charging time. However, the sound is barely noticeable, with certain shows, which has been a big disappointment for me. Therefore, I did take a star away. But I still highly recommend this as a good purchase.",0
B09886Q4PW,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,1 March 2023,the United States,False,This is my 4th HP Chromebook since I believe 2013. It is almost exactly like the one I purchased two years ago on Amazon that is still fully functional. It's a great little device. I like the backlit keyboard because it allows me to use the laptop late at night without any additional lighting source. The sound system is great. I can store everything I need to store. No complaints. I hope this one lasts as long as all the others.,0

B097ZGCGVZ,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,25 October 2021,Mexico,False,"Hare la reseña sin meterme mucho en especificaciones tecnicas pero lo que la mayoría de las personas entienden o necesitan saber y que me hubiera gustado encontrar cuando la compre, En general compre este equipo para ocio, leer y trabajar de vez en cuando planos en Autocad o algún programa similar de arquitectura.
• TECLADO Para empezar al ser de USA viene el teclado.sin Ñ acentos y demás, pero eso se puede arreglar en la configuración y presioanrias la tecla que normalmente es en español, estoy acostumbrada a trabajar con laptops grandes que tienen el teclado numerico y esta no lo tiene pero no me molesta tanto, en cambio en modo tableta si aparece teclado num. al lado derecho. Cuenta con teclado retroiluminado que se puede poner y quitar. Cuando quieres usar el teclado en pantalla aparece como una aplicación que se me hace poco práctica en modo LAPTOP, PERO NO ES NECESARIA, pero cuando das la vuelta en modo TABLET ENTRA EN AUTOMATICO ESTILO TABLETA O CELULAR Y ES 100% FUNCIONAL.
• PANTALLA: Como en otros comentarios y según mi experiencia con la marca lenovo no usa colores muy brillantes y se sienten algo apagados, el brillo como cualquier otra lap hay que ajustarlo de acuerdo a la iluminación. La pantalla se refleja es estilo brillosa si la vez en un ángulo inclinado no se ve (ejemplo si alguien más llega y ve la pantalla de lado va a batallar para leer o ver pero de frente sin problema). Cuando esta en modo tableta se gira la imagen igual que una tablet según la pongas. No cuenta con marco delantero esta la pantalla completa.
• BOCINAS a pesar de ser Dolby Audio no siento que sean tan buenas, tenia 2 Toshiba con sonido Dolly y no se compara con la calidad del audio, y comparándola como tableta contra el ipad pro que tengo el ipad es por mucho mejor en sonido, sin embargo es aceptable.
• INTERNET he visto en línea varias reseñas acerca de la tarjeta con la que cuenta estas computadoras, y mencionan que falla demasiado.... en mi experiencia cuento con internet de Fibra óptica y mi casa no es muy grande, funciona perfectamente bien, aclarando que hay zonas donde se pierde la señal pero es normal por las frecuencias de otros equipos que interfieren en las ondas del Internet ejemplo la cocina, o también lugares con mucho vidrio como un baño pero eso er normal COMO EN TODOS LOS DISPOSITIVOS, y para ello cuento con un MESH OVNI y me resuelve esos problemas. Trabaja con frecuencia 2.4 o 5 Ghz de acuerdo a la red que la conecte, pero es rápida.
• PROCESAMIENTO estoy muy agusto pues manejo programas pesados y me es necesario hacer multitareas a la vez y con cualquier otro dispositivo esto hace que se alente mucho. Realmente la memoria ram de 16 de esta es ideal, en segundos realiza las acciones que normalmente todas las personas usan.
• DISCO DURO ALMACENAMIENTO PEQUEÑO! Aunque esto ya es el común en todas las laptops, No se a quien se le ocurrio... supongo que es cuestión de mercadotecnia excusándose que ya no es necesario por los clouds ... pero no encontré ningún modelo que tuviera más de 512GB sin que pongan la leyenda de ""gamer"" (lo cual las hace sumamente costosas por el simple hecho de clasificarlas así y sin necesidad de que sean realmente buenas o lo que se requiere realmente para ser una gamer)
• SIN LECTOR ÓPTICO DE CDS igual ya tiene tiempo que han dejado de ponerlo en las laps, es muy molesto ya que muchos de los productos actuales en el mercado cuentan con CDs para las instalaciones de xs programa necesario ejemplo las impresoras o scanners (para lo cual hay que buscar los drivers) tiene solución pero es un fastidio en mi parecer, yo en realidad poco lo uso pero habrá quien lo necesite para entregar información en CDS por ser más económico que estar entregando memorias...
• ACCESO LECTOR HUELLAS/PIN/ CONTRASEÑA acceder con la huella es fácil pero hay que tener la huella limpia he visto que dicen que falla, no en mi caso, funciona a la perfección y cuando no la reconoce por que pongo mal el dedo o esta sucio da la opción de poner el PIN o contraseña configuradas, cualquiera de las opciones funcionan.
• ENCENDIDO AUTOMATICO desconozco si aquí en México sean ya las laptops más nuevas así o si sea particular de la marca pero cuando abres la pantalla en automático se enciende es como si nunca se apagara o estuviera hibernando nunca tarda en entrar. Al igual hiberna en automático si no la usas aunque esta parte es ajustable los tiempos de espera. A PESAR DE ELLO WI CUENTA CON BOTON DE ENCENDIDO.
• PILA hasta ahora realmente buena pensaría que no duraría tanto por lo mismo que da la impresión de estar prendida siempre como una tableta, no sabría decir cuanto dura pues no la he usado maximo 3 o 4 hrs seguidas por día pero pasan entre 2 o 3 días entre cada carga.
• ELIMINADOR DE CORRIENTE TIPO C, esto se me hizo suuuper raro ya que estaba acostumbrada a verlos solamente en celulares o tabletas, sirve de igualmente como trasferencia de datos con cables C hacia celulares o dispositivos? Lo que no se si es lo mejor por durabilidad y que esta limitada a una entrada C. Por ahora es funcional
•SIN PUERTO ETHERNET.... si eres una persona que no cuenta con una buena conexión de Internet WIFI, ni te estreses en comprarla pues no tendrás opción de conectarla directamente al módem.
•CONFIGURACIÓN INGLES A ESPAÑOL aun no he encontrado la forma de que todas las aplicaciones o menús queden completamente en español a pesar de estar configurado a español, si no sabes inglés se te dificultará su uso? Supongo que se podría arreglar pero no se como hacerlo.
• PROGRAMAS son como una combinación de los tradicionales y aplicaciones (apk).
• COMPATIBLE CON ALEXA y similares, de hecho viene la app preparada.
• PEN (LA PLUMA!!) NO ESTA INCLUIDA me hubiera gustado que viniera incluida al igual que las HP, estoy en busca de una que sea compatible de la marca.
•TOUCHPAD no tiene botones, táctil y se puede manejar con dos dedos el zoom de la pantalla.
• CAMARA tiene para taparse si no está en uso, aún no la uso para decir que tan nítida sea la imagen.
• DISEÑO es delgada, color gris, no es pesada aceptable para ser usada como una tablet, no me gustaría que el teclado no quedara completamente expuesto al usarla como tableta, los bordes no son redondeados lo que para muchos podría ser un fastidio, los ventiladores en la parte superior abajo, hay que cuidar de que no se tapen por que no trae estilo las gomitas que hacen que queden las laps ligeramente despegadas de las superficies y que le requiera respirar, tiene lógica por ser una pantalla 360° pero xomo usuario si hay que cuidar de ello, al igual como.comentaba al no tener el marco que tienen las pantallas normalmente hay que cuidar al abrir de no presionar we más la pantalla para no hecharla a perder (también leí eso en línea). En la parte de enfrente tiene magnetismo por la orilla, no se si sea por las bocinas o si sea para la pluma se pegue.
•GARANTIA hasta donde se tendría que hacerse valida en Estados Unidos por ser el pais de origen, así que de nada sirve que compres la garantía extendida a menos que tengas forma de llevarla.
•ENTREGA fue antes de lo previsto en todo momento se mostró en donde iba, llegó la caja del producto completamente sellado de fábrica sin ningún golpe, dentro de una caja de Amazon con bolsas de aire en el interior.
EN GENERAL ES UN BUEN EQUIPO A BUEN PRECIO A PESAR DE LAS CONTRAS QUE TIENE Y HASTA AHORA TODO ESTA BIEN.

B097ZGCGVZ,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,30 March 2022,Mexico,False,"Llevo poco tiempo con esta laptop sin embargo he de decir que me ha sorprendido bastante.
Antes ella tenianla Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 y quedé decepcionado por el precio y la mala calidad en algunos apartados. Esta por el contrario me ha sorprendido.
Estaba dudoso en comprarla por las reseñas que hay arriba pero aquí mi experiencia:
-La laptop trae W10 de fábrica, uno puede actualizarla a W11 lo cuál me ha dejado satisfecho y sin ningún problema.
-Actualice los drivers y BIOS y no he tenido ningún problema. Arriba leí que se desconecta del WiFi o que no actualice el bios pero lo he hecho y mi internet es estable para jugar en linea sin que se desconecte y no he tenido errores en cuanto al sistema tampoco.
-Es cierto que no viene la pluma y compre una Lenovo que va muy bien, he hecho dibujos en la suit de adobe y no hay problema
-El procesador es una bestia y hace todo en cualquier momento.

El único detalle que he encontrado fue una parte de la pantalla en la bisagra derecha, parece como si no estuviera unida debidamente pero, no he tenido inconvenientes con el touch ni al darle la vuelta

UPDATE/ACTUALIZACIÓN:
después de casi un mes de tenerla, me aparecieron 3 pantallazos azules debido a que actualicé el BIOS. Al parecer si hay un defecto con ello porque la restauré, le instalé exactamente lo mismo que tenia antes pero sin el Upgrade del BIOS y ya no he tenido ningún problema. La testeare más antes de definir si regresarla o quedarmela, esta muy completa en todos los aspectos.

Update 2
Me quedé con la laptop y después de restaurarla no he tenido ningún problema, cuenta con W11 y va de maravilla, la tarjeta de WiFi al parecer si falla aunque la he actualizado sin embargo es solamente estando a mas de 10 metros aprox del router en red de 5G, en una de 2.4 no he tenido problemas

B096VBG93J,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,11 December 2024,the United States,False,"I bought this laptop in mid-2022 for gaming. I generally put graphics and settings for all games I play to medium, but the laptop heats up really quickly and is pretty loud, even when using an extra cooling fan. It plays most games just fine, but some games will immediately kick on the internal cooling fans. I've gotten used to it for the most part, but it's always jarring when turning my laptop off to realize just how loud it was before.
Also, in the last few weeks, the network adaptor has been cutting out and dropping the WiFi. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the driver's multiple times, and while it initially helped, it's gotten to the point that the laptop just doesn't register that it has a wifi adaptor at all.
So while I could continue to use the laptop for writing and offline things, I mainly got it for gaming, which I can't do without internet. It lasted 2.5 years, but I feel like laptops should last longer than that. Battery life isn't too bad though.",0

B096D61WTZ,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,7 March 2022,the United States,False,"The tl;dr is this is a good gaming laptop for only like $900 and a ram upgrade is recommended.

For the price the GF63 thin is good at what it does and you'll be happy with it. I use it for gaming while at work so I've had plenty of time to test it out. First off most games run really really well on this since the display is only 1080p and it has a laptop 3050 in it. When I bought it I was worried the 3050 wouldn't be enough to play games like tarkov, dying light, back 4 blood, or the forest since these are all games that, without fine tuning settings, can be hard to run with mid level specs. I was pleasantly surprised with how well they ran. The high refresh rate display is buttery smooth and feels good in games.
This is a thin laptop, which everything in the machine revolves around but I'll start by talking about cooling. The laptop has one fan that has one large intake with a smaller one near the exhaust and two exhausts with one on the back and one on the side. The two on the sides have the fins with heat pipes running through them. It honestly isn't clear if the smaller intake really is an intake or an exhaust but when I hold my hand near it while the fan is running it feels like an intake. It's a small vent though so it doesn't matter all that much. This really isn't enough cooling for the cpu (10750H in my case) because under heavy loads the cpu often reaches temps above 95C. For this I would recommend a cooling pad to promote airflow. The 3050 however remains pretty cool because it's utilization is usually pretty low. The cpu is definitely the bottlenecking factor here so keep that in mind when deciding between the version with the less powerful cpu. I was eyeing the $800 one with the weaker cpu and I'm glad I got this one. Next I'll go over the ram and storage. My model came with 8 gigs of ram and 500 gigs of storage. This amount of ram is not enough for the cpu and for the games I play it was maxing out while in game. For that I strongly recommend buying a minimum of 4 more gigs but preferably 8 more gigs. I'd recommend buying 2x8bg of some good ram (make sure they can handle running at your cpus max frequency or you're not getting as much as you can out of the ram purchase) and don't look back. As for the storage, if you're like me and this isn't your main rig 500 gigs of storage is plenty. However if you're getting into the world of pcs and this is going to be your main rig then definitely look into some higher capacity storage. It runs and NVMe ssd but when I opened it up I forgot to look and see how many NVMe ports there were or if there were any SATA ports.

The keys are large and have shallow press depth, with relatively light resistance. The keyboard is membrane but the keys feel responsive. The typing experience just isn't the best, but that's not really what this machine is for if we're being honest. The track pad feels precise and low latency with good clicking feedback. Overall the build quality is low. Because it's so thin the deck flex is high and the plastic is thin in many places. For the previous upgrades I mentioned you will have to take the back plate off and there are many places you can break the plastic. Use an ifixit kit or the like and use a YouTube guide so you don't bust your back plate (watch out for the ports, the hdmi port on the back and all the io on the right side was tough for me). The thinness is really nice if your on the go a lot because it makes this thing really light. Having a big bulky gaming laptop while you're going from class to class gets old. On the topic of being on the go, prepare to be disappointed with the battery life because it is not good. Playing games while on battery will get you less than 60 minutes of play time, idling on performance mode will get you 2 hours while idling on best battery life mode gets you 2.5 hours. Your mileage will vary depending on brightness and things like that. Overall the battery life isn't the best but for a gaming laptop not too shabby.

If I had any regrets in buying this it would be that I wish the cooling was better, that it had more robust build quality, and the cpu was either faster or was an 8 core so it wasn't bottlenecking the gpu. Honestly look for a laptop with the ryzen 7 4800H and a 3050 if this is the price point that works for you. It would probably be cheaper, run cooler, and push higher frames. Kind of kicking myself for not doing that myself, so do that and don't be like me. If you do end up buying this though, you won't be disappointed you'll just wish you could've gotten something better.

B094XGXK1T,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,20 March 2022,the United States,False,"Purchased this laptop after having numerous issues with the other Ideapad Flex 14"" from 2020.

Everything is working out of the box as expected. I purchased as brand-new and it came as brand-new from the selected seller. The USB ports work fine, the Camera works fine, and I was able to swap my SSD Windows 11 drive into this one after having to verify the microsoft account, yet again, through Microsoft (Do NOT loose any information from your Microsoft Account or you will be unable to use the SSD that it is installed on as a regular customer unless you plan on starting from scratch).

This part is very important. As mentioned above, if you are running Windows 10 it is just the matter of putting in your password and or pin into the login screen. If you have Windows 11 on a SSD/HDD, you must verify that you are the account owner through Microsoft. I do not like these restrictions, and, although they are totted to be preventing fraud or account theft, in actuality, its just so that Microsoft can track who brought what at X location and any information that was provided. That is the bottom line, not security of the user, but more-so, tracking down the user. They are trying to copy Apple now and I hate it.

Some physical differences between this laptop and the 2020 IdeaPad Flex 14"". The 2020 has the casey/case open up from the top where the keyboard is. This one opens from the bottom like a traditional laptop that makes it easier to do upgrades or repairs. Be warn however, this laptop is set to automatically turn on as soon as it opened up. Make sure to completely drain the battery before attempting to remove any hard-ware components or upgrades to lower risk of electrical shock.

I have also discovered something new with the 2020 and newer laptops. For the Lenovo brand, instead of having one screw type that fits for the casing and the hard-drive, there are 2-3 different screw-heads used. Make sure to buy yourself a versatile kit that can handle all the different types. An investment I brought for $14.00 back in 2014 that included screw heads for glasses and laptops with two plastic openers, curved tweezers, two suction cups, and a prying rod saved me $130 dollars for labor of switching out a SSD card. It costed $0 after finding a tutorial and doing it myself.

Warranty: Do not bother with Lenovo's draconian Warranty. You are better getting any repairs done at a pop and mom shop. I have had their warranty and it has been despicable. I was charged $200 for a failed 20GB RAM card that was considered 'third-party' by Lenovo and that they would send the laptop back if I did not send them the money. I was in the middle of my college semester and had very little choice as I needed the laptop back working. It had already taken a week at the Lenovo Facility and I was without a laptop having to use the computers at school for my work. When the same 2020 14"" model had issues with the camera, I was given two contradicting information by customer service. One told me, after having freshly renewed the warranty, that this situation occurred suddenly under the 'old' warranty and that it would not be covered by premium services. Then the other one told me that it would be covered under the new warranty, but there was a catch. The customer service person was trying to encourage me to wipe my hard-drive. I refused. They then told me if they sent a technician over, they may wipe the hard-drive.

Wiping hard-drives does not solve any hard-ware related issues, and instead, will help create a loss of personal information. I do not know why so many IT related companies get away with this type of procedure. If it was their database at their job, they would NOT wipe the entire database just to solve one issue! They would go in, find the specific issue, and fix the problem. This is not fixing the problem but destroying data in the assumption that the software is just not working so, rather than diagnosis the problem and solve it, wipe the hard-drive.

Components: It comes with the laptop and a c-port charger. If you have the Ideapad 2020 charger you can use that instead and it will still charge the laptop. It also comes with two thin manuals(c-port charger and using the laptop), a 15% off discount flyer, but no registration card. I am assuming that Lenovo wants customers to go directly to the website and register the laptop.

-WARNING-
This laptop does NOT support thunderbolt USB-C. Keep that in mind while looking for external devices such as tablets that rely on this. I've come across this issue very recently and purchased this product only to find out later it does not support Display Port for the USB-C.

About Extension Screens: If you are using an extension screen, which many come with magnets, be warn that the circuitry in this model is more sensitive than the 2020. There has been multiple times if, by using the Mobile Pixels laptop brand, I do not snap the magnets on very gentle and at the angle the laptop will power-off even if the magnets themselves are not touching the laptop directly, but from the action of the magnet touching the other magnet on the laptop case. I can power the laptop back on manually with the power-button but I do not know the long-term effect of this. Try to steer clear of the magnet-based extension screens, which unfortunately, are many. As a side note there are hidden magnets near the top and bottom parts of the laptop, which makes it stay shut once closed. You can find them by dangling a piece of thin metal near these areas until it 'sticks'.

Windows 11 Compatible: Yes

Performance: It's advisable to change the 8GB RAM to 12GB or 16GB in a single stick. I had a 20GB RAM before in the other one but it was a faulty chip and sent it to Lenovo. Got charged $200 for a vague description that the RAM I upgraded with was a 'third-party' and therefore justified the charge for a RAM chip that costed $60. Don't bother dealing with Lenovo's warranty, your better off getting any problems fixed at a fixed purchase at a mom and pop's shop than waiting for a week and a half with Lenovo just for them to barely fix your problems and charge you outrageous prices like the issue above.

Lenovo Warranty: Trash. There's always one representative that tries to nickle and dime the customer or take advantage of customers that are technically ignorant. I am not the last one. Just use the warranty it comes with if you have to but don't bother further renewing it. I had Lenovo try to pull a fast one before with the previous IdeaPad 14"" laptop that, regardless that I renewed the warranty and it was in the process of activating on the website is, because it happened after the old one expired, I wasn't eligible. I talked to another representative and they said I was. Conflicting information. Most of their workers are over-seas with low pay so it shows in the quality of the customer service. Don't bother with their warranty, your much better off with a Pop and Mom's shop that will service the product properly.

If you want to prevent this from happening, you need to update your bios, which is not too hard, but typically beyond a normal person's repertoire. You should be able to find this on the Lenovo support site.

The camera is decent, I've only used it for GoogleMeets and it looked good. Other than that, this laptop is really fast and even cute.

Update: I removed one star because the laptop gets overwhelmingly hot when plugged in to the charger, it's absurd. On top of that, the laptop freezes after 2-3 days of sleep mode, so you have to completely turn it off -- losing any document you didn't save -- and then turn it back on, to the point where I get nervous whenever I'm working on a Word doc out now. Not what you expect from an i7-11 gen...",0

It weighs half of what my old 12"" laptop weighs. The backlit keys are easily readable without turning on any room lights. Battery life is awesome. I love it!

Edit 8/22/2022 - Everything is going great with this laptop. I'm having a little problem with how sensitive the touchpad is. As far as I can tell there's no way to make it less sensitive. Any accidental touch will make something happen that you might not have wanted. I just have to remember to keep my hands away from it when not needed. The keyboard is easy to read at night with the backlight on. During the day it's best to turn the backlight off with the F8 key to get the best readability.

That one had touchscreen, which I miss, but this newer Swift is a great laptop. It is lightweight. I love that as sometimes I travel with my computer and lighter is better! The only thing I haven't liked is that even when the sound is at 100, it isn't very loud. Two thumbs up Acer! You have earned my brand loyalty.

Easy to set up, runs Windows, etc. I'm sitting there playing a game six days later, and all the sudden a puff of smoke comes out the back. Now I'm sitting here staring at Acer's chat support app. If an agent ever joins the chat, I'll update this review. As of now, it looks like I paid $1,100 for a brick.

UPDATE: It took almost six weeks, but I got the laptop factory-repaired for free, and I have it back. It's a nice laptop for what it costs. By way of illustrating that point, the first thing the Acer support people said to me was ""this'll be easier if you just send it back to Amazon. They'll give you a replacement immediately, and we'll repair the unit on the back end."" Only problem was, a week after I bought it, the laptop was completely backordered.

From where I sit, this product seems like the kind of thing where you can get a deal for being willing to put in a little elbow grease. The Acer factory maybe needs better QC, but their Tier-2 tech support handled the problem about as well as could have been expected.

If it breaks again I'll update.

B093HFL39L,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,22 May 2022,the United States,False,"pros:
- The build quality is great.
- While the thick bezel is a bit dated, overall it looks sleek and clean without having an overstated design.
- The keyboard looks and feels nice.
- there are lots of ports to connect devices, including USB-C and ethernet.
- processor: Ryzen 7 5700u for only $750. This was the only laptop I found after months of searching that achieved this price point without any special discounts.
- There was not a huge amount of bloatware on the system, it was pretty easy to remove in a few minutes.
- This 8-core processor is very capable, and its vega iGPU can play almost all games if you are willing to compromise on quality settings, fps, or resolution.
- Comes with windows 10. Windows 11 is the newest OS, but it is still full of bugs and glitches and doesn't add many new features besides more compatibility with p-core/e-core processors (which this laptop does not use) For this reason, I think that windows 10 is the superior operating system for most people right now. However, you also have the option to upgrade to windows 11 for free when you setup the computer or later on. Thanks for giving us the choice, Acer!
- There are only 8GB of RAM, which with modern apps and operating systems is simply not enough (especially since the iGPU draws from system RAM!) However, I also see this as a pro because there is one open memory slot. (the 8GB it comes with are soldered on) This means that if you are comfortable opening up the computer, you can install as much memory as you want, and I like the customization. I chose to add 16 GB (which cost me around $80) for a total of 24, and that is plenty.
- there is space for adding an extra m.2 or 2.5mm storage device inside.
- battery life seems OK, I haven't played around with it much. You can make it last longer with power saving features.

cons:
- the screen does not deal well with glare from sunlight. If you work outside, then you may consider a different laptop.
- Since this laptop does not support thunderbolt or USB 4.0, it is not capable of PCIe tunneling, so you cannot connect an external GPU.
- The charger uses one of those circular connectors, not something standard like USB-C. (the USB-C port works for everything but isn't meant to charge the laptop) This means that you can't just use any phone or laptop charger, you need to use the correct one that came with the laptop. So just make sure you don't lose it!
- ugly stickers. Like all laptops, this one comes with branded stickers on the inside. Make sure you take them off before you heat the CPU up so that the adhesive doesn't melt them on! Once you remove them you can see the laptop's true beauty.
- the next-generation 6000-series processors look like they will provide even more bang for your buck, especially in the graphics department with their RDNA 2 graphics architecture. However, with all of the chip shortages, it looks like these processors which supposedly launched in February still won't be available, especially in budget form like this, for many months. I wouldn't pass this computer up just because of FOMO regarding the next-gen chips. The 5700u is still a very capable processor and the best deal you will realistically find in the near future.

Honestly just one problem.

I realized It after the fact but uhh, it's a ""5700U"" focus on the ""U"" . It has awesome power saving capabilities. I've watched movies on it for more than 32hours total without charge with a little stretch.

The problem comes in when you charge and your laptop needs more power than the charger can give and the laptop can take because of the type of charging port. The port is skinny as is the plug so I guessed it. ""U"" is basically a low power usage or saving and/or around that area.

-Overall I still love it even with that. Pretty good budget. That was my only issue. All the other ones is Microsoft and windows fault lol. (Giving us Bad updates)

A real nice deal for what I got, so funny how high powered computers are a fraction of what computers used to cost many years ago, but buying fast food or any food in general, breaks the bank now. It's so backwards but that's what it is nowadays.

The particular device that I purchased was sold by Amazon and shipped by Amazon. I decided to leave this review over a year after I bought it because I just felt like leaving a review since I am using it more now and trying to not use my phone as much for internet surfing (like the old days!). The configuration I bought was one of the higher options available at the time but as of the time I'm typing this review over a year later, this laptop is only available on Amazon through third party sellers and it looks like the listing has changed to only the specific model that I purchased (Acer Aspire 5 A515-45-R3SU Slim Laptop | 15.6"" Full HD IPS | AMD Ryzen 7 5700U Octa-Core Mobile Processor | 8GB DDR4 | 512GB NVMe SSD | WiFi 6 | Backlit KB | Windows 10 Home). At the time the model that came with Windows 11 was $100 (maybe more) more expensive than this one and this was immediately upgradeable to Win11 so that made no sense to buy of course lol. But this particular model is a great unit and highly recommended. Haven't found anything to complain about other than that the touchpad is a little more annoying to use than on a previous laptop I had, but I just use a good old fashioned mouse which is 1000x better than any touchpad anyway.

O notebook é muito bonito, a tela é linda, o teclado retroiluminado é um show à parte, o metal da tampa superior passa um ar mais premium.

Falando sobre performance, antes eu utilizava um notebook com um i7 de 4ª geração, e a diferença foi brutal!! Trabalho com diversos programas pesados, como o premiere, blender, photoshop, illustrator, e todos rodam tranquilamente, sem esforço algum.

Sobre upgrades, ele acompanha um ssd nvme de 256gb e uma ""case"" para adicionar mais um ssd sata - foi o que fiz, adicionei mais um ssd sata de 512gb. Já para memória RAM, existe um slot apenas - e ele está vago! Logo, acredito que os 8gb do notebook sejam soldados na placa-mãe, o que é vantajoso em um futuro upgrade, podendo adicionar mais 8gb e assim acionar o dual channel (muito melhor do que os lenovos vendidos aqui, com 4gb soldados e 4gb no slot, que caso sejam trocados por 8gb ou 16gb, ativariam o dual channel em flex mode apenas).

This is an overall solid laptop. I've been using Acer's for years and they always perform to my expectation. Sure, you're not going to game very efficiently on this or render 4K videos in 30 minutes, but for the average computer user, this is the ticket!

Processor is very fair for moderate desktop/workstation use and the SDD really speeds things up - if you're used to traditional HDD, you're in for a surprise. Solid states have come a long way and it shows when even simple, mid-grade laptops like this run lightning fast!

The compact, lightweight case is also great. It's strong enough to handle moderate abuse and travel, but light enough to not be cumbersome. The keyboard is meh, but most laptop keyboards are so no issues there. Mousepad is the same - not impressive but not a major issue either.

Overall, this is a great laptop for school, work, or normal home-business tasks. If you're looking to game or use processor or graphics-card taxing applications, then this isn't the laptop for you. Not to say it can't do it, but it definitely won't do it well.

B091XRXRNP,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,28 September 2020,the United States,False,"(Edited again ) After 3 month of use this are my impressions. So far its soo good so impressed with this product even after 3 months use. My model is with Amd ryzen 4700u.

Body : Laptop is made of aluminum and its very sturdy i will say its really really good for the price. I wish it had more colors as this black is matte and its a fingerprint magnet. And the 360° hinge also very good one.

Port : The port selection is good 2 normal USB(usb 2.0 and usb 3.2 gen 2), HDMI port, 1 usb Type-C, headphone jack, Kingston lock and charging port. I wish the Usb Type - C supported charging (it doesn't support charging and display port just for data transfer).

Display : Its good for most users and for my use its really good. It covers 60% SRGB ( if your photo or video editor who need 100% SRGB then go for others). The panel itself is good and have decent brightness level for my use i usually keep at 35% . And its touch screen and the touch response is soo good.

Performance : My model comes with Amd 4700U and the performance is very fast. Its soo good whatever you are doing it can handle very well. And the fan noise silent for normal use and if you doing heavy task the fan noise increases but it's under control . [(update) Also if u are doing light stuffs like reading a pdf or doing some light stuff the fan completely turns off. So its super silent for light users.] There is performance fan mode in MyAsus App which increases fan speed and noise for performance mode. For gaming i don't know i actually didn't use for gaming but it can handle some gaming i guess atleast from internet i saw it has a Nvidia Mx 150 like performance.

Ram : 8 GB Ram comes on board and the surprising thing is one slot is expandable. Out of the box it comes with 4GB sorted + 4GB in expandable sort. It can be upgraded upto 16 GB Ram so it can handle total of 20 GB. And this itself makes one of the best reason to go for it.

Storage : 512 GB SSD its fast and even that is upgradable.

Battery : (update) Now after driver updates and windows update My laptop goes 7-8 hrs normally and if using light stuffs it can go all the way upto 12-14 hrs. Thats a massive change after updates. So now u don't have to worry about charging. And the charger is very compact 45 W charger its small and it can fit in any bag.

Wifi card : My model comes with intel wifi 5 and its good. And if you want that's also upgradable. This laptop has so many user replaceable parts that make it best for customers even if you don't need to upgrade it can be useful for future needs.

Track pad : Its decent the tracking is very good but the button are not that great atleast for my taste.

Keyboard : The keyboard is good one with backlight. And it has very decent travel and i like the shortcut keys in function keys and you can change it when you want to use function keys(eg: f1) by just pressing FN +esc and it shows a small led color when its in Function button mode in FN button . The only thing i would say bad is that the ""back space key"" is little smaller than normal laptop.

Camera and Mic : Not good not bad its just a typical laptop camera but the mics are surprisingly good one.

Speakers : The speakers are good. Just goto Audio wizard app and change it into Movies it literally makes the speakers very good.

Pen : I am not a professional but from my usage for normal note taking usage it was good one. And it comes in box.

Security : It has fingerprint sensor and it so fast and it also supports windows hello.

Conclusion : (updated) This laptop is Excellent for the price of $699 for Amd ryzen 4700u. It balances out every thing for the price. And the value for money is 10/10. The only Downside is the stock of the product it just finishes so quickly. Otherwise this should be one of the popular laptops. For those who trying to buy this laptop. My advice is constantly check the product page because it sometimes suddenly comes to stock.

B091XRXRNP,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,24 December 2020,the United States,False,"Most of you are on Windows. If you are, you can pretend that this review has 5 stars because everything works fine on Windows, and Microsoft did a very good job with their touch UI. Hell, I'm even thinking of just giving it 5 stars.

The AMD Ryzen in there, along with its integrated graphics, is very fast. It beats my (old, but still kinda beefy) gaming pc in frames per second on Minecraft. Battery lasts forever. It's also very quiet. Under light loads, the fans don't spin at all, and when you start doing heavy stuff, they still spin quietly, and the whole thing stays cool.

When AMD dropped these processors this year, they made a statement that says nobody should have to pay extra to get a machine that doesn't suck.

I got used to the keyboard and touchscreen very quickly. I don't have like a million laptops to compare to, but I can say the keyboard is nice and comfortable. Build quality is metal so this will last you a long time.

And upgradable memory is really something you want. 8 GB might not be much in a couple years, but if you start running out, you can replace one of the 4GB sticks with a 16, giving you a very nice 20GB of ram. Many companies are moving towards soldered ram, which is sad.

So if you're running Windows, and want a 2 in 1 that runs quickly, this is the machine for you. You can stop reading the review here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But if you run Linux, and want something that you don't have to fiddle with to keep running without having to make sacrifices, you should look somewhere else. I hear good things about Lenovo, so you might have better luck over there.

I don't like Windows out of personal preference. I'm a developer, and while Linux Subsystem for Windows is getting better, it's nowhere near as good as running the real thing. I'm also a little paranoid when it comes to my privacy. I'm not gonna run an operating system that mines my data, and I wont take any of that ""nothing to hide, nothing to fear"" crap. I might as well go for a walk with no mask and no pants. There is nothing wrong with having something to hide. Valve's proton is getting better and better, and almost all my games run faster on Linux, so I game on Linux too.

Now, I knew what I was getting into. Linux touch UI is not the best. I'm running Ubuntu 20.10 (sorry its not arch). Some apps play nicely, mostly Gtk apps and Blink based browsers (Chromium, Chrome, and the one I use, Brave). But it's nowhere near as good as touch support on Windows. But, that's why I got this. I'm hoping to make touch support better on Linux, and I can't really do that if I don't have a touchscreen Linux machine.

Some other things also don't work out of the box. Some function keys don't work. Only volume, brightness, touchpad, keyboard backlight, and lock screen do. When you flip the screen over and use it like a tablet, the keyboard stays on, so you'll probably bump keys. The screen doesn't rotate like it does on Windows. I've seen some fixes going around but I haven't had the chance to install them so I can't tell you how well they work. They probably work well though.

Fingerprint only kinda works. On Windows, you can just tap and you're fine. On Linux, libfprint can't get a high enough resolution image, so you have to carefully swipe your finger over the reader. It works, but it takes a few tries to get right, so you're probably gonna be faster just typing your password.

But what really caught me off guard was that when you sleep it, the kernel hangs about 80% of the time when you wake it up. It doesn't stop the fans when you do sleep it either, so it will keep burning battery. You're better off setting it to keep running when you close the lid like I have, and shutting down if you wont use it for a while, which is fine because even with dm-crypt full disk encryption, it still boots very fast.

Turns out ASUS used some weird UEFI implementation that breaks away from the standards. Only Microsoft's kernel works with it. There's no documentation for where it breaks the standards, nor is there source code or even closed source binaries for it. It's all up to reverse engineering projects, which I will probably join as soon as I get the chance.

Everything else works great. AMD's graphics drivers run great on Linux, and if you choose the community driven open source alternative, those work good too. Wireless is more stable than my old laptop (Dell Latitude E6330).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before I end this review, I just want to say that ASUS does not support Linux, and they don't have to. Most people run Windows. ASUS wants to focus on making the more popular operating system run as good as possible. We made the choice to run something else. Even if their choice was for money, there's nothing wrong with that because they have families to feed.

We should not be toxic with them for making this choice. I see a lot of yall getting toxic with companies who don't support Linux. ASUS will probably change their mind if there were a lot more of us, but if the Linux community is known to be just a bunch of toxic nerds who throw a fit if some innocent company refuses to spend millions of dollars paying engineers and licensing code just to please like 19 people, we will never grow. If we don't like it, we need to either fix things ourselves or go somewhere else.

edit: with ubuntu out of the box i later realized audio had a noticable delay. if you have the same problem, ill lay out some steps for those with little to no terminal experience

1. open a terminal
2. run the command `gedit admin:///etc/pulse/daemon.conf` without ` and type your password when it asks
4. go to the bottom of the file and add two new lines, `default-fragments = 5` and `default-fragment-size-msec = 2`
5. save and close the text editor
6. either go back to the terminal and run the command `pulseaudio -k`, or just reboot your computer

this is from https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Troubleshooting#Laggy_sound

ill be back with more fixes as i find them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

edit: 21.04 update just came out, which switches the default compositor from x11 to wayland. i was excited to move to wayland with its promises of better performance and security, but i got worse performance from it. i tried launching half life 2, and it locked up my whole display. game made sounds and everything but i couldnt even drop into a tty. so make sure at the login screen you click that gear icon and select ""ubuntu on x.org""

the login screen will still run on wayland, meaning you have both x11 and wayland running at the same time, which means nothing for speed once youre in x11 as far as i know, but it will slow down boot time a little bit and hold a little bit of extra ram. if you wanna get some of this ram back, you can edit the file /etc/gdm3/custom.conf

1. open a terminal, this time type `gedit admin:///etc/gdm3/custom.conf`
2. fine the line where it says ""# Uncomment the line below to force the login screen to use Xorg""
3. uncomment the line below it by removing the #
4. save and close it

on your next reboot, x11 should be all that runs. if you want you can uninstall wayland, but it shouldnt really take up too much space and i dont know how a system upgrade would react to that.

wayland will get better in the future though, its just not ready for this machine rn.

sleep is still broken sadly. a little bit more reliable but not for daily use.

I got this gaming laptop as part of my first setup for my Christmas/birthday present. I absolutely love it! It has been a little less than three weeks since I first used it and it is working great. In general, I would recommend if you are just starting out your online gaming experience.

Specifics: The keyboard is really good (which I am using at this moment). The track pad is eh, it kinda skids my thumb but I can give it a pass. The screen is really nice, with great detail. Battery life is not great, but if you are just using it for searching online it is okay. If you want to play a full on game you may want to plug it in.

Game performance is amazing (transferring from a Nintendo Switch, playing Fortnite, to a real gaming device is a vast improvement in my opinion.) Running max graphics gives me 80 FPS and I can play good graphics on a stable 120 FPS. Games load fast, and overall very smooth experience. (I really don't know if this is just me, but trying the laptop on the first time the FPS would be very random but after a while playing, maybe after a few days, it got stable.)

Well, thanks for reading! :) Just want to assure that my experience was great and wanted to make sure you know what you're buying. Bye! (haha)

Then, the same thing happened to me : Laptop not charging, not booting ...
I tried different chargers, no change, no charge, not booting.
Then, I noticed that Acer had the excellent idea to put in place a custom system in the charger female pin on the laptop that requires you to push hard to insert the charger pin.
So, if your laptop is dead on arrival, check that you pushed enough to insert the charger pin in the laptop, it may seems stupid but I believe it's a design flow. Acer : Fix that !
Other than that, the build quality seems OK for an Acer, the keyboard is great, the screen excellent. The laptop is quiet (when you don't use the boost mode). I didn't had time to use it much yet, so I didn't test the performance, but no doubt that it will meet my expectations.
I noticed however some lags with the touchpad when you ""wake"" it up. It seems the touchpad go to sleep and needs at least one or two seconds to take your input and wake up.",0

1. No cuenta con suficiente almacenamiento, por lo que obligatoriamente tendrás que agregar, al menos otros 500 gb, la ventaja es que puedes agregar un SSD de tipo NVM, o uno convencional sata 3, pero no los dos al mismo tiempo.
2. La RAM es rápida pero si quieres tener el mejor provecho debes agregar otros 8gb, para hacer el dual Chanel, ya que juegos demandantes como Warzone, no te deja jugarlo con 8gb, que realmente solo puedes usar 6.1gb, ya que tiene cierto espacio, para los gráficos integrados, cosa que puedes modificar entrando a la BIOS, para esto debes de usar un pincho, el que usas para sacar la SIM de tu celular, ese mismo, del lado derecho el equipo trae un orificio, le das un pinchazo y entras a la BIOS, podrás encontrar tutoriales, de como bajarle memoria a los gráficos integrados, que no es complicado.
3. La batería es bastante mala dura 2 horas o 2 1/2, pero recordemos que esta diseñada para el Gaming.
4. El brillo no es el mejor, y por lo demás creo que es un gran equipo, que lo recomiendo si lo encuentras por menos de 15,500 pesos, de otra manera hay equipos mucho mejor.
5. Las temperaturas y los ventiladores son muy buenos, pero debes tenerlo elevado unos centímetros de la mesa, para que pueda correr bien el aíre, de esta manera incluso jugando GTA V en gráficos ultra, no llegas a los 70° centígrados.

B08YKHGKTV,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,11 January 2022,the United States,False,"This is an all-plastic laptop, but has a fairly rigid build, not like metal, but far less flex on the screen than my 5 year old Acer Aspire which needed many replacements due to flexing including a cracked screen, hinges, and back cover. This has 8 GB memory. This has and older GTX 1650. This has a 120hz display (unheard of at this price point) This has 256SSD m.2. It has a backlit Keyboard. It has an amazing processor: AMD Ryzen 5.

Here's the deal. You can get similarly priced laptops that have more storage and RAM, touchscreen, etc... but you will trade down the pieces that future-proof this machine. I can walk into Walmart and get a similarly priced Pentium, i3 or a similarly priced i5 with more RAM or storage or maybe a touchscreen (if that’s important to you), but no dedicated graphics, no backlit keyboard, or expansion slots for ram or SSD. However, I can always buy more RAM or hard drive later when the price will actually be lower. I can NOT come back later and upgrade the CPU, add slots to increase the RAM, and all of a sudden make my keyboard visible in the dark when I want to work late at night sometime. I can't later upgrade the screen to 120hz as this one has. And, the GPU at this price range is perfectly adequate (Although not as future-proof). The Battery has a LOT to be desired and could be a deal breaker. I can get 5 to 6 hours if optimized back (all but battery-saver mode). My old Acer had 12 hour battery, but the screen was a significant tradeoff.

Some people are saying only 6 GB RAM. That is because of the new way Ryzen processors use dedicated RAM instead of shared RAM. There is 8, it is just that old processors shared the RAM with the system. Now the new processors are dedicating part of the RAM to the processor permanently. It isn't too much different than before, but does change the way the RAM is handled and displays for availability for Windows.

My system is gaming fine right now with the existing setup, but I'm not a power user. I'll wait until I can't live with the performance and then I'll go buy more RAM and SSD when it comes down lower in price, because I can. Beware of machines that downgrade built in pieces to give you more memory and hard-drive, but will be outdated in 4-7 years instead of 7-10+ years depending on what you plan to do with the machine. Those are not good tradeoffs. Lenovo seems to have hit a sweet spot in this price range with its optimal upgradeability and good built in features for for the price you pay.

If you need a power machine, this is not it. This is a good midrange machine that will allow you to do a diverse amount of tasks without lagging out or crashing, and should last a long time with the specs it has.

I loved it. But when I had to upgrade, I genuinely didn't want to spend too much as a working student. I did a lot of research and yes, the top brands of ACER , ASUS, HP, ALIEN they had great laptops obviously. But finding this one was a god sent. I can clock out at 240fps on most of my games. The upgrades to 16gb RAM and to add my HYBRID drive was flawlessly easy. The design is very sleek, mint fresh and effortlessly classy and simple. In fact, it stays well hidden as a gaming laptop. It's lightweight and easily portable for travel as a student compared to the 7lbs most gaming pcs start with.

The cons I had with this were it was a bit smaller than the average 15.6 laptop. A bit. Measured, it's a direct 15.6 but still pales by a slight inch to normal laptops. The other issue is that the fans are beneath and there is no air flow towards the back of the laptop. So, I would advise investing in a cooling pad for playing demanding games in order to protect your laptop. Furthermore, it only has two USB ports. Not a massive deal as I can easily buy an external USB device to add more ports but it was a let down. Apart from that, those are all the cons I would say, which pale in comparison to the pros.

In conclusion, this is a beast of a laptop. To find an affordable laptop which upgrades easily and has amazing fps and runs smoothly while providing easy portability is rare. The cons are things which can be easily overlooked due to the vast amount of pros this offers. If you're looking for a budget gaming laptop as a student, this is definitely your buy.

B08YKG5K7F,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,27 April 2022,the United States,False,"Lenovo Computer Review

I’m no IT guru, so this is a total non-techy user review. I’ve owned and used this laptop computer September of 2021, and I love it! It was well past time for an upgrade, and I spent a lot of time looking at laptops, trying to decide what fit my needs and wants best. I narrowed it down to a few from Asus, Dell, Acer, and Lenovo. Even though this is marketed as a gaming laptop, it’s important to note that I am not a computer guru, nor am I a gamer. I don’t own a single game, so I can’t review it from that standpoint. I simply wanted a computer for everyday computing and web surfing, managing my music collection, editing photos, and running my telescopes (astronomy is one of my hobbies.)

For my purposes, this computer is fast! It boots up in just a few seconds. The graphics are great! Being able to change the keyboard backlighting color is a great feature for me. Astronomy is a hobby of mine, so my keyboard lighting is red, since I don’t want bright light sources ruining my dark-adapted night vision when I'm using the laptop with my telescopes at night.

No computer is perfect, and I do have a few minor nit-picks with this one, though there are none that I find unacceptable. First, this computer came with ABSOLUTELY NO DOCUMENTATION! No manual, printed or otherwise. Not even a quick-start guide. No CD with a manual or utilities. All you get in the box is the laptop and the power cord/AC adapter. In spite of the lack of documentation, it was pretty easy for me to power it up and start using it. Next, the AC adapter is very bulky, compared to the ones that come with most other laptops. It’s about 6”x 3”x 1”, it’s heavy for its size, and it’s situated in the middle of the power cord. I will say that the power cord is quite long, which is good. The power cord plugs into the back of the unit, rather than on the side. There’s only one USB port on right side of the computer, and there’s a USB-C port and a headphone jack on the left side. I would have preferred two side USB ports, but there are three more on the back of the unit, along with a HDMI port, another USB-C port, and a LAN connection. There’s plenty of connectability, if you don’t mind most of it being on the back of the unit. The speakers sound like typical laptop speakers, and I think it’s silly to expect much more than that. I use headphones, Bluetooth speakers, or I just Bluetooth my music from the laptop to my home stereo system. Last, the battery doesn’t last long as long as I’d like, but that’s to be expected from a computer with the high-end processing and graphics capability this computer has. For every day, non-gaming use, I get about two-and-a-half to three hours of use from the battery before I need to recharge it. If you need portability power, you’d do well to use all of the power saving settings, have an alternate power supply to plug into, or an extra battery, or consider another computer altogether. Again, none of these are things that cause me any real issues, but they might for others. In spite of them all, I do love this machine!

One of the things about this computer that was a big selling point for me is that it was sold directly by Amazon, rather than a third-party vendor on Amazon. I hear a lot of hard luck stories from folks who bought computers from third-party vendors who had a tough time either getting warranty service for computers with problems, or returning them for refunds. And a lot of computers offered by third-party vendors have been modified by those vendors. I read a lot of reviews from customers of a lot of those units, complaining of inferior parts being used for the mods. Luckily for me, I had no desire to return my computer, nor have I had any functionality issues with it. But when I have had to return anything to Amazon, it’s always been a no-hassle experience for me. And to top it off, the Amazon price on this computer was less than that offered directly from Lenovo.

What I like:
Looks great!
It’s fast! Boots up in only a few seconds.
Graphics are top notch.
WIFI and Bluetooth work well
Keyboard backlighting colors are changeable (red is my preference)
10-key pad on keyboard (I use this a lot!)
Sold directly by Amazon (at least it was when I bought mine)

What I don’t like:
NO documentation
The battery could last longer
Most of the connectivity ports are on the back of the computer
Bulky AC adapter
Annoying occasional sales nags from McAfee and Microsoft. Fairly easily removed.

Contacted Seller who said the warranty started when he bought it and I could buy an extended warranty if I wanted a longer warranty. Not informing the buyer of this situation is in my view deceptive. I would not buy from this Seller again.

As for the laptop itself, it was new in a sealed box. I bought one with 512gb storage, 16 gb ram and core i5. As I read elsewhere, it is better to spend your money on storage and ram rather than an i7 chip as the laptop throttles down when doing heavy duty tasks so you don't get the benefit of the i7 in that situation and you don't need it when doing more routine tasks.

I quality build with a useful Lenovo feature that it turns off when you walk away and turns back on when you are back in front of it (this feature can be turned off). Keys are very good but the keyboard is a bit cramped (left to right) since this laptop is so small. Trackpad is first rate and seems easier and more accurate that other laptops I've owned (asus, lg gram). Battery life so far is very good. There is one fn key (f12) which the user can set up. I did task manager as that otherwise requires several clicks to get into.

My 1 complaint would be the speakers are not good at all and should be much better for a higher end Chromebook. Other than that; I like its speed (I have the 5 with 8gb ram). I wish it would be able to log in with your fingerprint from the start of the computer, but using smartlock with my phone seems to work, most of the time. As I learn more and more about the Chromebook, I am seeing that I can do almost everything and more than with my Window's laptop. I need to learn how to use the stylus better. This is definitely a well made Chromebook, except for the lousy speakers. I am VERY happy with my purchase.",0
B08Y588P78,Anonyme,2.0,Sans titre,2 July 2021,the United States,False,"I really wanted to keep this Chromebook. It is a nice color of blue. It has incredible build quality. Feels better than a Mac! Screen is really nice and plenty bright. I prefer the 16x9 format. The speakers are good enough for me. The hinges were tight. The keyboard was a dream.

The problem is that no matter how good all the above was the cpu or apu, Ryzen 5 3500c performs really bad on Chrome OS. All video playback on apps, and through the browser had choppy playback. Gaming was terrible and pretty much unplayable. I tried updating, trying beta channel and nothing helped. Such a shame because if it had an 11th gen intel i5 I would be writing an entirely different review but the Ryzen 5 is really bad. I actually feel bad for Lenovo. Hopefully they will make a gen 2 and AMD will use 5th gen mobile chips next time. 3rd gen AMD Ryzen was just okay but was plagued with video driver problems. AMD made a big mistake here. If they would have even used a 4500u the performance would be night and day. Considering Chrome OS doesn't use resources that much and the Ryzen 3500c should have more than enough power and gpu but it feels like a Celeron with 4gb ram???",0

B08Y588P78,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,11 June 2021,the United States,False,"Good point.
ThinkPad's unique key touch and track point.
ThinkPad service manuals are available, and you can replace parts yourself (continuing the ThinkPad tradition).
Comfortable operation with powerful AMD Ryzen and VEGA

Bad points
The sound quality from the speakers is lower than the ringtones from a smartphone.
Android apps are slower than expected.
CPU cooling fan noise is annoying.

There was an AMD Ryzen-powered Chromebook that had been appearing on benchmark sites since 2020 under the codename Zork, but it has finally shipped as a product.
The Zork name could be seen in the Android settings of this device. Also, as of June 2021, the device is running the equivalent of Android 9.

The Pixelbook Go also has an unusually good key touch for a laptop, but this device also has a very good key touch for a ThinkPad. It's hard to compare the two, but both are very good.

The size seems to be almost the same as the ThinkPad X series.
Here's a picture of the ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook on top of the ThinkPad X240. The size is the same. It fits perfectly.
In addition, the weight seems to be the same. I didn't have enough arm strength to use this as a tablet PC.

I guessed that it would be difficult to run all the Android applications due to the architecture and origins of the OS.
However, games that use a lot of 3D were much heavier than I expected, making them unbearable to play.
Some of them can only be played in tablet mode.
It would be tiring to flip the lid every time for an Andorid app.

One thing that bothered me was the sound.
The sound quality of the speakers is so bad that you'd think it was a 30-year-old NEC laptop.

Secondly, the sound of the CPU cooling fan was also annoying. If you wear headphones, you won't mind. The heat exhaust port is located near the hinge, not at the bottom, so the sound may spread easily.

I've written about the good and bad points, but my satisfaction rating is 5 stars.
I like AMD Ryzen and don't really like Windows, so this is a good companion to carry around outside.

Also the charging port is the same upside down or right side up! You don't have to fiddle with the port to rightly plug it in. Important to note, set-up was a little tricky as you have to sign in as a user/ owner to take it out of ""guest mode"" which allows you to bookmark your favorite pages to immediately have access to your faves, that involves setting up a Google Gmail account or using an existing one u have, other than that it's a handy, simple unit that is very well worth the price.

This one is very responsive. Windows and web pages open quickly. My most heavy-duty application is a Microsoft Access database that I wrote. It was a bit slow on my old Dell but runs smoothly now.

The screen is important to me and I couldn't ask for more except maybe for something much bigger (but then it wouldn't be a useful laptop). Very easy to read, bright colors, good detail. I should warn you that the last Lenovo Yoga we had had to be discarded when its screen went haywire.

I don't like laptop keyboards and this one is no better. or worse, than others. They are too flat for my fingers to feel them properly. I simply attached a wireless keyboard.

There's only one conventional USB port and two Thunderbolt ports (Type C connector). One of those Thunderbolt ports is the charging port. That could be an issue for some users.

B08XPC3WFQ,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,9 August 2021,Mexico,False,"Después de 3 semanas de uso, definitivamente es la mejor laptop que se puede obtener con respecto a calidad-precio cuando el precio se encontraba a $22,000 o menos. Por los $30,999 actuales estoy casi seguro que se puede encontrar algo mejor.

Siendo una lap gamer, les puedo dar como referencia que corre Warzone, con gráficos bajos (pero sin perder esa sensación de juego de penúltima generación), a 50/60 fps. Probablemente agregando más RAM mejore un poco, pero no gran cosa.
El resto de los juegos los corre sin ningún esfuerzo ya que son menos demandantes.

Pros:
- El audio es bueno.
- La tarjeta gráfica es un gran salto desde las GTX hasta las RTX serie 3000.
- Contiene 1 slot para agregar más memoria RAM y otro para agregar más almacenamiento (SSD).
- La pantalla tiene muy buen brillo y es de 144 Hz de refresco.
- La estética es modesta, pero muy agradable a la vista.
- Muy buena ventilación para las tarjetas y no tan ruidosa como otras laptops gamer.
- Tiene WiFi 6 que es un gran boost y plus en México debido a que los modem de los proveedores de internet son malísimos. (Si tienes un router gamer, no notarás mucho la diferencia).

Contras:
- El procesador, a pesar de ser 11a generación, se queda algo corto por ser de sólo 4 núcleos. Hay procesadores de 10a y hasta 9a generación que lo superan.
- No tiene cámara web (esto es algo más de decisión de cada uno).
- Es difícil esquivar una de las salidas de aire caliente con el cable de alimentación de corriente, lo que provoca que el cable se caliente por el aire y, a la larga, pudiera dañarlo.

B08XPC3WFQ,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 April 2022,the United States,False,"This laptop is for someone who wants a laptop to take around and do productive work on and also play modern games at high settings. There are others with faster GPUS, but hardly any that can claim 6-9 hours of battery life like this one. There are tons of battery saving features, like a dedicated key to change what power profile to use. The 144hz screen auto sets to 60hz on battery so save battery life. Gaming on a AAA game at high settings, 30 fps, I get around 2-3 hours of battery life. Less demanding games can go more. Other contemporary laptops i've used can really only game for an hour or so while on battery. You can also set the battery life to be capped at 80% or 60% to extend it's usable life. I usually keep it on 80% and still have long battery life. And it comes in at a hell of a competitive price.

#CPU

The cpu is a bit lacking when compared to other 6-8+ core laptops, but it's a good tradeoff for the lower TDP (and less power consumption). It is more than capable for most peoples work though. It cannot be undervolted like any new intel chip, which I did not know until researching it.

#GPU

The 3050ti has been able to run any game I throw at it on high settings, and older games can be ran easily on my 4k monitor and the native 4k resolution.
It can get fairly loud when gaming at high performance for awhile, I game with headphones so I don't notice it when i take them off. But this will be an issue for really any gaming laptop, especially one this thin.

#Ports
Thunderbolt 4 can be connected to external docks and external GPUS. Allows 100w usb c charging so you can run laptop off one cable, but keep in mind this is less than the 180wpower brick, and if you are gaming at high performance, it will slowly drain the battery unless you also have the power cable connected. I also got a 50$ external 20000 mah battery with 65w usb charging which can bring the laptop from 10-80%. Nice!
It is annoying how the ports are all at least half way down the machine, as the top half is for the fan outputs.

I am able to drive two 4k at 60hz monitors, an external HDD, mouse and keyboard, and charge the device all from a single cable. For those whose primarily use a laptop at a desk setup like me, and occasionally like to take it off to go work on the couch or bed or something, this makes it super easy just having the one cable.

#Upgradeability

There are 8gbs of ram soldered onto the board, and an additional slot, which I throw a 16gb stick in for 24gb. There is an additional m.2 slot which I put another 512gb ssd in. Speaking of which, the SSD is crazy fast. While looking up benchmarks for other laptops, this one easily beat them all. I don't remember exact numbers but it's there.

#Display

1080p, 144hz. Good color reproduction, and clear sharp images. Does not look washed out or anything. Not the brightest for working in sunlight though, but it's usable.
The screen cannot tilt back 180 degrees, more like 140 ish? I use a laptop stand so I cant have it as vertically tilted as I like, but for 99% of people this is a non issue. The hinges feel solid and don't seem like they will crap out or break off like other.

#Keyboard & Trackpad

The backlit keyboard (one color, changeable brightness with keyboard keys or using software, also has different modes like breathing) is solid. Key travel is not shallow and has a good click. I do not notice a difference in quality with my Mx master key keyboard.

The trackpad is average. Not glass, but precise and not an annoying texture. Not much to say on it. It gets the job done.

#Design and build

It is marketed as a 'tough' laptop and while it doesn't feel much different from a normal laptop (and isn't metal, it's some sort of hard plastic polymer), I have had 0 damage in the year i've owned it.
The Tuf Dash f15 is solid, yet lightweight and not annoying to lug around. It is thin and not too heavy, and has similar dimensions and weight of most high powered ultrabooks. It has an attractive design that reminds me of a razer or macbook, I wish it didn't have the 'TUF' on the lid though it is very subtle coloring thankfully

#Bugs Glitches & Software

This is the first laptop i've had where I have not encountered really any bugs or glitches. I have had BSOD but I am almost postive these are from the Dell TB16 thunderbolt dock i'm using. Even these have only happened 2 times in 3 months.
The laptop is ran off of Asus Armory Crate service, which has features such as profile switching, game optimziation, system tweaking and more. It can be accessed via a dedicated key. It is not super lightweight of a program, but not overly consuming either. You can close the program in task manager and the laptop will not have any issues, just some features are closed off.

I replaced it with a newer wd black mobile 2.5 inch performance hard drive and it made all the difference. I would still really recommend this laptop.

Cooling is also very good, you can upgrade the ram, and I have had to clean the internal dust maybe two times or so. its also really quiet. I appreciate the bunch of ports it has, plus the always on USB port on the left side that can save you in a tight situation for charging a device.

Es perfecta para hacer trabajos ya sea de oficina, de diseño y para las clases en linea, si quieren una Laptop para jugar videojuegos esta no es ninguna opción para eso.

Posee un buen tamaño y es bastante ligera, cuenta con teclado numérico pero lamentablemente se trata de un Teclado en Inglés, eso significa que la letra Ñ no está en el teclado y obliga a aprender un poco sobre donde está ubicado cada simbolo en el Teclado si lo usas en Español.

Como mencioné la Laptop está pensada a futuro, esta se puede abrir para añadir mas memoria si consideras que los 4GB de RAM que posee no es suficiente y permite además insertar un segundo disco duro por si consideras que los 128 GB que posee por defecto no son suficientes, por cierto la unidad de almacenamiento principal es una unidad NVME lo que garantiza un arranque casi inmediato al encender el equipo. Por cierto dentro de la caja del equipo viene incluido unos tornillos para instalar la segunda unidad de almacenamiento, lamentablemente no vienen instrucciones para hacer la instalaciones y hay que buscarlas en Internet.

Con tanto positiverío debería haber algo negativo, la pantalla fue lo que menos cuidaron a la hora de diseñar este equipo, la calidad y nitidez de la imagen no es tan buena y para los que trabajan en diseño se les dificultará un poco trabajar por el poco rango de color que posee la pantalla, no es mala pero si toma tiempo en adaptarse. Por otro lado el equipo dice tener Alexa integrado, pero no encuentro como usarlo y lo único que veo de la función de Alexa es que en la pantalla de bloqueo me avisa si algún paquete de Amazon va a llegar durante el dia.

NOTA: Es una mentira que viene con Windows 10 instalado, cuando me llegó venía ya con Windows 11 instalado y nunca me dio la opción de regresar a W10, tuve que descargar la herramienta de instalación que Microsoft ofrece en su sitio web para no perder la licencia, tomen eso en cuenta si no les gusta Windows 11 y no quieren perder tampoco la licencia al instalar W10.

(Probably a good thing but still obtrusive) the right click is always a gamble. If you work with sensitive software, this would be your undoing.

Wish it had two USB 3.0 and two USB C, instead of the single USB3.0.

I don’t know if I damaged it, or if the aux port just doesn’t hold anything in. If you have to reset your audio driver (Voicemeeter, installed for audio workstations) everytime it brushes out, you will loose your patience.

I can hear creaking in the hinges, it brings me concern how long this product will last flipping into tablet mode.

It lets me switch modes if I want to have the touchpad (FKA mousepad) enabled or the top row to do software function or hardware function, which is nice to have. But then you don’t have a nub in the center to control it. And no clicking mouse keys, just a springboard of a mousepad.

Handles multitasking well, good keyboard, snappy finger print reader, good battery life so far, good screen, etc.

One thing to note is that the screen is brighter than I expected. Many of the review youtube videos mentioned that the only weak point for this machine is the screen being not bright enough, so I was a bit concerned about that, but it is still bright enough to review drawings on site. Of course, it is not as bright as my iphone, but bright enough to see drawings, texts and images clearly outside on a sunny day. If it is not for an art work that requires accurate colour correction or something, it won't be an issue.

This is a great notebook that can be folded back to serve as a tablet when you really need it to. I don't work on a tablet mode, but when I am going around site checking things against drawings or specs, being able to hold the machine in a tablet for is really helpful.

I wouldn't say it is a great tablet. It is rather too heavy and large--it could be a better tablet if you get 13inch model, but I don't know. The aspect ratio also is not suitable to be a full time tablet. It is a bit long to hold it in a portrait mode. And the fact that you have the keyboard and trackpad on the bottom is not very comfortable when you are holding it or setting it a dirty or uneven surface.

I would recommend this machine for anyone using the machine primarily as a notebook with an occasional need to hold it in a tablet form.

A great machine I am very happy with.

1. Poor quality/ erratic audio over zoom - usually it works fine, but occasionally my students say they cannot understand me at all. When I switch over to phone audio over the same call, it works fine, thus proving that the issue is with this machine. Incidentally, a friend who bought the same model is also facing the same problem.

2. Camera is a bit grainy, but I can live with that.

3, The edge of the laptop where my wrist touches it is really sharp. I am currently looking for solutions!

B08SJTW9LK,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,23 July 2021,the United States,False,"This computer is a beast. What I was really impressed with is how long you can use it on battery if you aren’t doing heavy gaming. You can set it to igpu mode which will let it last 8-9 hours on battery as long as you put it on silent mode. For streaming, browsing and doing documents it should last at least 6 hours.

I really wanted a 1440p screen but with this screen at 300hz it’s beautiful! I’m not a big fan of LCD but it’s a very high quality screen. Pictures don’t do it justice. If I want 4K I’ll just hook it up to a TV.

I like that it’s a very small 15’ laptop. It’s not chunky at all and it’s not over designed. I thought I would have heat issues with a 3070 but the laptop handles the heat very well. It’s not burning my legs when gaming.

I’ve had no problem playing all my games maxed out. A lot of the benchmarks I see for this use poorly optimized games so it’s not fair to this laptop.

The keyboard is nice. I didn’t want a mechanical keyboard because they get noisy. With LEDs off on everything it looks low profile. It’s really easy to turn the LEDs and to customize.

I really haven’t seen any bottlenecks for what I use it for. This laptop is the sweet spot. In my opinion this is better designed than the Zephyrus because the rear heat exhaust isn’t hitting the screen.

Only thing I would have liked to see is a numpad with the keyboard and an aluminum frame.

B08QV5HGHT,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,11 April 2021,Canada,False,"had this laptop for about a month now. Moving from a 15"" Macbook.
Shipping was surprisingly fast. I preordered expecting to receive this middle of April but it showed up at my door in late march! What a great start!

2 Screens. Game changer with laptops! I find I'll always have my emails open on the bottom screen while my work is on the main. the ""swap screens"" button is genius for switching between tasks on the go. I was worried i would always trying to have at least 2-3 programs running to feel like I'm utilizing the duo screens. Now it comes pretty naturally and i don't feel guilty anymore even if i turn off the bottom screen just to surf. The bottom screen is noticeably darker. I always have it set to max brightness. DO GET THE NEWER VERSION, that lifts up the bottom screen! I did test drive last years model with that static screen, and that little bit of propping does make a huge difference! Having touch screen capability really nullifies the issue with the tiny useless track pad. I don't use the pen that much, but i did purchase a BT mouse.

I love the build quality. There's no screen flex and keyboard is a rock and an absolute pleasure in typing. Even when the whole laptop is propped up on the folding stand it comes with (it did take me a while to figure this out!) it still feels planted! Sound is surprisingly good, not mind blowing. USBC charging FTW, and the battery lasts all day (at work) for me with medium load of emails and basic graphics (AI/PS) work.

Cons? Small complaints. It's heavy. I only carry it from the car into the office in a backpack, and i notice it. This track pad is pretty garbage. you can adjust the tracking sensitivity so you can swipe edge to edge to help, but get a mouse. can't open single handedly. It does come with a case/bag(?) which has a little loop to store the pen. would love to have a slot or clip somewhere on the laptop itself. Unfortunately the strap in the bag that holds the pen down is lose enough that the pen always slides out every time I put it into my backpack sideways.

I got the basic model (i7, 8GB memory, 528GB HD) wouldn't mind upgrading to 16gb, but I don't any lag. IDK if I would purchase the 15"" version. having the 2 screens really nulls that extra size. I really love how small and compact this feels when closed and in my hands. Yeah, I would purchase again.

B08QV5HGHT,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,13 March 2021,the United States,False,"Hi Guys,
This review is after just having the Asus UX482EA, 14”, FHD, i7-1165G7, 8GB RAM, 512 SSD, for two days. I really wanted to have the 16GB version, but that was hard to find. What I wanted to do on this laptop is basic office stuff, Word, Excel, PPT, internet searching. The heaviest work would be reviewing high school football film. A little streaming. I am not a gamer. Pretty safe for the 8GB model. So, I just went for it. I think I was in the mood for something revolutionary. In short, I love this thing! I was debating between the Dell XPS 13” and this one. They have different applications, and I would have been happy with either one. I just wanted something different and not the standard clam shell, open it up and use laptop. This second screen set up is more than a gimmick and becomes particularly useful. The reason why I am posting this is for the external monitor question/answers that were minimal. I was able to hook up a 27” external monitor via the HDMI port. Like I did with my previous Asus Q324u 14”. Windows identified the external as a #3 display (Yeah!). This is great for me for breaking down game film. I have zero complaints really. Just the adjustments like in previous posts. You must move to the left a little bit to reposition for the keyboard and you have to get used to the touchpad on the far right. It is not so much the touchpad, but the left/right “mouse keys” on the far right. I, like most would be, am used to the pad at center point. So, invariably I keep hitting the space bar instead. Absolutely not a deal breaker. I am getting used to it and use a separate mouse anyway. The graphics, screen brightness (almost too bright at max setting), board keys, speaker sound, battery life are more than adequate for me. Also has a USB 3.2, so I do not have to carry a hub with me. But has the USB-C if I do! This unit (again with 8GB) was $300 less than the XPS and I got it in three days. After all the shopping and researching overkill! I'm super happy with this one! Maybe I'm too easy to please? I hope this helps someone out there!
3.31.21 Had this thing for almost 4 weeks. Still love it. Addressing some comments about the hard to see second screen plus or that you have to look over the top. I just found a $10 angled laptop stand on Amazon. Easy fix or adjustment. see added pic. for what its worth.
5.22.21 Update: Still love the thing. I'm with the posts that think the Duo is a fingerprint magnet. To address it, I put on a carbon skin designed for a Dell. Trimmed it down and here we go. Corrects my fingerprint OCD. note: I lifted the ""Dell carbon circle"". Now I have a teal blue spot on my lid. Just to be different.

B08QMW12T4,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,21 March 2023,the United States,False,"Ok so there's a lot to adress here so I'll make a simple list.
Pros:
Backlit keyboard(F7 button for thoes wondering)
Dead cheap for the specs (dual GPU Ryzen 7)
GPU and CPU are similar levels meaning you wont pay extra for power you dont use(GPU power between the MX450 and Radeon Vega is roughly similar to a GTX1050)
Pretty screen
Cheap for a powerful 2 in 1
Cheap 2 year warranty (about $50)
Fast charge
All aluminum body
Face ID
Powersaver really works

Meh:
SSD wasnt recognized once (likely a bad startup) and scared me to heck
Frame has weakpoints at the USB and HDMI ports
Gets bright enough, not too dim or bright

Cons:
Batter lasts 3 hours on most power, with max saving 6 is your best even just watching youtube
RAM is the bottleneck and cannot be upgraded

So it has a lot of major positives, but some pretty deep cut issues. Unbeatable if you arent willing to pay the little extra for like an HP envy x360 with a weaker GPU but more RAM.

When I first opened the box, I heard something rattling around. Upon investigation I found that the bottom panel of the laptop was not properly secured. There was a screw loose right in the middle! I thought I would try it out anyway, so I booted into Windows. First of all, it was supposed to come with Win 10, but came with Win 11 instead. Fine, I can deal with that... Then just to test things out I installed Chrome and opened a few YouTube videos. According to Speccy, the CPU hit 73 degrees C. Something was definitely not right!

I promptly boxed up the laptop and sent it back.

Other things to note... This thing was a fingerprint magnet. I don't even have greasy fingers or hands, but barely touching the laptop, the cover, case and keyboard would show smudges and grossness. All the surfaces are some weird matte material, and I couldn't even wipe the smudges away. Gross! Another reason I wanted to try the ThinkPad was for the up-firing, fancy speakers. They didn't sound any better than my old laptop with downward speakers. Also, for a 16 inch laptop, they should have really put a full size keyboard with a number pad.

All these facts -> Totally unacceptable for a laptop in this price range. I ordered a different brand straight from the manufacturer.

I loved that device and probably would just keep using it if this device wasn't on discount.

First this is an amazingly well appointed portable and lightwieght laptop. Its got all the latest technologies, Intel 11 gen processors, thunderbolt 4, etc. The build quality is amazing, rigid but light, comfortable ergonomics, large trackpad, nice surface finish. The screen quality is also very nice, its not the best but very nice. One key aspect is the number of IO ports, 2 thunderbolt 4, 1 USB 3.0, HDMI, mini-HDMI ethernet, headphone/mic jack. Webcam has a physical security window and trackpad has ASUS numpad thing. The keyboard has a nice layout, but it probably my least favorite aspect of this laptop. It feels a bit ""gummy"" rather than tactile, this is really my only major complaint.

In terms of performance this thing is zippy, no issues doing anything besides serious photo/video editing. I primarily use this for coding and its as good as it gets. When I first turned this on with Windows the performance was good but than fan speed was obnoxious. However, I'm a Linux user so this wasn't going to sticking point.

In terms of support on Ubuntu Linux, it works very well with some minor hiccups. The best part is the linux kernel always deals with fan speed much better than windows so its never a problem. Everything works out of the box besides the following:

1. WiFi doesn't work unless you use the latest linux kernel.
2. Numpad ASUS features don't work
3. Fingerprint sensor doesn't work
4. Most hotkey FN work except F8-F12

None of these are show stoppers for me; I was able to address 1 no problem.

Overall strongly recommend this laptop, its just awesome.

Went though 3 replacements just to be sent the same wrong color and no backlit keyboard all 3 times even though I actually like the grey color better than the all black.. Amazon compensated me for the difference so decided to just settle since I truly needed it for work and couldn't wait any longer.. Would advise buying directly from a store in person but sometimes you dont have many options and this is by far not the worst route.. No issues with the screen as so many reviews mention and had pretty decent FOV.. Other than the mishap several times this computer would of got a 5 star review which I don't think it was asus fault.. Definitely be weary which company you buy from because alot are remanufactured or have the wrong hardware that do not match the specs fortunately this was did.. Arrived ahead of schedule each time and not in only the manufacturers packing.. Great buy as long as you don't need a backlit keyboard which I truly don't but is a great feature to have especially when for the same money many other companies offer touchscreen and backlit.. Overall not super upset having to settle because the laptop is performing better than expected..,0

This CPU is going to be significantly better than any intel Celeron or atom processor in this price range.
It also beats out all the price comparable i3 chips by 50-70% - the i3-1005G1has a passmark score of only 5261.
This AMD 4300u is a fantastic value at this price range.

The integrated graphics are good enough to easily watch 1080p video, and keep up with the demands of Windows. I would not recommend this for any serious gaming.

128gb m.2 ssd - would prefer 512gb+ but again, can upgrade this later for a relatively cheap cost. There's only room for one m.2 so it would require replacing the drive and reinstalling Windows (or your operating system of choice).

IPS Touchscreen is quite nice, the responsiveness of the touch screen is 'mediocre' but for the cost of the laptop, it's still impressive.

Speakers sound good, touchpad is responsive, and keyboard feels good to type on.
Build quality feels good and there is a bit of resistance when flipping the screen into tablet mode.

Overall for the $447 I paid at the time, it was an excellent deal for a low to mid-end 2 in 1.

B08LGKVNT7,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,12 August 2023,the United States,False,"Be sure to check out my video review in the video section!

It’s amazing how much laptop you can get for very little money these days. Chromebooks especially can be found at very low prices yet can pack a lot of value when it comes to usability.

This is a low-cost option that offers a functional secondary computer for basic tasks or a primary computer for kids and others who don't need more than the basics. It is powered by an AMD A6-9220C dual-core processor, 4 GB of RAM, and 32 GB of eMMC storage - just enough for what it is capable of running.

The Chromebook has an 11.6-inch TN display with a maximum brightness of 250 nits. While the display is not touch-enabled and the colors are muted, the build quality is solid, with a weight of 2.46 pounds and an estimated 10-hour battery life. The keyboard is not backlit but offers a comfortable typing experience and the trackpad performs well.

The Chromebook has two full service USB Type-C ports (although only one display can be output at a time) along with a pair of USB 3 ports, an SD card reader, and a microphone/headphone jack.

The device’s performance is sluggish, especially when compared to similar Chromebooks with Intel processors. But for basic tasks it’s fine and the battery life is pretty good for that type of work.

The speakers provide better sound quality than expected, and the device is compatible with Android apps and Linux. The end of support date for this Chromebook is June 2027.

Overall, the IdeaPad Chromebook 3 is a good value for those who manage their expectations and require a basic, functional laptop.

As value packed as this machine is there is a better option out there – if you can find it. The Acer Chromebook 311 I reviewed a few months back had a higher quality display, faster performance, and the ability to output dual displays.

I come from Dos/Windows/Android systems and there was and is still a bit of adjustment needed and my guess is ios users would have more of an adjustment.
We're very happy with the screen quality and the touch screen functions...just getting to scroll easily is a major plus. Makes a nice bridge between tablets and pc's and I have a real keyboard. The 12 hour battery means I don't even bring my adapter with me most places...and since it is usb C on the charger...I can use a cord on anything to top it up away from home or in the car. I wish the screen would do a full foldover so I could really use this as a tablet...but those seem quite a bit pricier. Streaming video and youtube with a decent connection is just fine but a gamer would want something more.

B08KH2Q1FG,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,24 February 2021,the United States,False,"I have had this laptop for around 24 hours, so keep in mind this is my very first impression of it.

First things first, the performance is outstanding for a laptop of this quality. I tested it out by playing Minecraft on the highest graphic settings with a large chunk loading distance and it ran like an absolute dream; constant 60fps and the bottom didn't even get warm! One thing you should know though: the fan is quite loud. There is a keyboard shortcut to limit how hard the fan works so you don't have to hear it all the time, but I could hear it from the other room while the house was quiet before I turned it down. So if you want to play any performance-heavy games, just know the fan will need to go hard and it will be loud, so just wear some headphones and you should be able to knock out the sound pretty well.
The SSD is pretty quick, I noticed a big difference in loading times for everything after coming from an older harddrive.
The screen is very high-res, and all of my background pics from my old computer look like 360p on it so I had to find some actual 4k pictures to use and they look fantastic. Resolution looks amazing all around, and I'm sure it can handle pretty much anything you throw at it in that regard.
The laptop is not very heavy at all for what's inside it. I haven't weighed it but just to show you, when i picked up the package delivery at first I thought it couldn't have been a laptop because of how light it was.
The battery seems good, I haven't had the chance to drain it past 50% and I'd like some more time with it to give a full review on it but it's quite adequate for anything low on power requirements and gives several hours on half charge. I would plug in for any gaming though, as I would for any laptop.
The laptop shell is quite durable, not like an actually military tuff book as it looks, but still nice and strong.
The keyboard is very nice, the keys are super high quality plastic and they have very soft clicks even if you type hard. Plus the LED rainbow backlighting is such a joy, I felt so cool when I turned it on like I was a real MLG gamer or something.
Overall this laptop is a dream come true, It's so powerful for the price you pay for it. I would venture to guess it's one of the most powerful low-to-mid-range laptops you can buy. I paid way more for an Asus 7 years ago that was only about a third as powerful, so it's nice to see how far technology has progressed.

And the beautiful metallic red color is gorgeous. I could only find a better laptop if I paid $1500-$2000. This one will last you. Not one issue with it, and every time I've purchased a new laptop, there are issues. Always something I've got to fix. I highly recommend the Asus S15 S533. I'm happy I got the red.

Ever since the day it arrived here, I have been at a loss to comprehend the nonsense one has to do, to be able to do ANYTHING. It seems that EVERYTHING has to have an uneccessary password and if you don't have one, then you have to apply to have a sequence of numbers sent to you and you have a very short space of time with which to apply those numbers, in place of a password. If it wasn't for the fact that I had paid a few hundred dollars for that junk, it would have felt the wrath of my hammer band earned itself a space in the garbage bin.So, now I'm pondering on what to do with it. Amazon is totally blamed for selling that Americanised rubbish here in Australia.....AND SO IS ACER to blame, more so than America. Amazon must stop selling that American rubbish in Australia.I have 12 blu-ray movies that cannot be played because they are labelled with the letter A. I can't play them, even though I have two ALL REGION PLAYERS.....NONE OF THE BLU-RAYS WILL PLAY ON EITHER OF THEM. ONE HAS TO APPLY THE PASSWORD AND THEN, APPLY FOR A CODE, WHICH ALSO HAS TO BE APPLIED, ALONG WITH THR PASSWORD.

My daughter asked for a laptop for her birthday, I had an older Alienware laptop I upgraded and gave to her brother to play Minecraft, and she understandably wanted something similar.

This shipped super fast during snow and ice storms! Well done Fed Ex!

The Good
The laptop looks nice, feels solid, and is light weight. Upon starting it up I was ready to put an hour or two into cleaning out all the bloatware and loading up the essentials; I was pleasantly surprised to find only 2 programs that needed to be removed(Lenovo something or other, and Mcafee). Boot time is very fast, the wifi is acceptable at this price point, and the gaming performance actually took me off guard. Now its just Minecraft but with a few adjustments in the settings(to optimize) I was getting 90-140 FPS matching the older Alienware laptop which has a 3840qm and a 7970m dedicated graphics card. AMD's APU technology has really come a very long way!

The Mehh
The screen is lack luster. Although it does give a nice 1920x1080 resolution the color reproductions is not great, its not bad.. but the screen always feels a bit washed out, I did adjust the brightness and a few other settings and cleaned this up quite a bit. The touch pad is... get yourself a mouse.

For those of you not Tech Savvy - No drivers were installed at all. Since this is AMD CPU/GPU combo its a very easy fix. You go to AMD's website download Adrenalin and it does all of the work for you, just install and follow the recommended driver installs. This made a HUGE difference in performance.

It runs FL Studio extremely well (a professional electronic music software).
It runs video games very well as well (I haven't gone below 25FPS in most games and I've reached over 110FPS in some games).
The screen is very large and can go up to 144 FPS (more or less, I don't completely remember).
NitroSense is a very good in-built application for the laptop.
There are EXTRA SLOTS for more RAM and SSD.
The laptop has a very good cooling system and my fans have never had to run more than 60% (I think).
You can't change the LEDs from the colour red but you can change the brightness.
I haven't tested the speakers yet because I use headphones.

The only thing I have against this laptop is that it has a battery life of around 2-3 hours but that's expected from such a high-performance laptop.

(Also this model was only $1000 for me, definitely worth the price)

I give the laptop a rating of 9.5/10.

B08H2H89K1,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,25 March 2021,the United States,False,"For the price and the specs you recieve on this laptop, it's a great computer. It's plenty capable of playing video games at high resolution, I've seen multiple game play videos of modern newer games being played.

It's pretty light too and feels and looks nice. It looks like a gaming computer too. I love the red outline on the keyboard as well as the red led lighting the keyboard has. (NOTE: This specific model only supports Red as a color option for keyboard back light.)

I've only owned this product for less then a day so far, but so far no issues and runs nice. I booted Sims 4 up real quick and was able to run at full resolution at 144hz.

The battery life isn't that great, but if you're near a outlet then just leave it plugged into the outlet. (Battery drains fast on high performance mode)

Overall rating: 5.0 out of 5.0 stars

Pros: Fast, Light, Looks and feels great, Red backlight keyboard, for gaming, budget gaming pc, vr ready,
Cons: Battery life poor on high performance mode dies in couple hours under normal usage, audio isn't that loud, even with volume at max settings,

Updated: after a bit of moderate to heavy use I do say that the heat is a major issue with this laptop. It gets extremely hot close to 200 which is way to hot. So I recommend buying a laptop cooling fan pad. It's plays cyberpunk2077 at the highest settings that I can adjust just fine though. If it can play that I have no doubts it'll play any other game.

出品者からメッセージで私からの返事がない、アマゾンのシステムのせいだとの内容ばかりで話が進まず、諦めました。
アマゾンカスタマーサービスの方では見れた写真も先方には見えないようで不良内容も伝わってはいなかったようで、諦めざるを得ませんでした

エイサーへ修理に依頼をしたら、海外の商品なので、高額になるから買い直した方が良いと連絡頂きました。
高い勉強代になりありがとうございました。

故障の内容は、写真の通りですが、外れたネジにプラスチックが付着していたので、ネジの外れ防止で接着剤で固定していたと思われます。
普通は修理のためにネジを外せるように接着はしないと思いますが。。

B08FCN53WM,Anonyme,2.0,Sans titre,15 January 2023,the United States,False,"Downgrading from 4 stars, to 2 stars in Oct 2023: Screen failing after less than a year. Display replacement is technical and pricey. On youtube, I think I could tackle SOME screen replacements. I couldn't find any videos showing how to remove the Spin screen. My Aspire has lasted longer (using it now) but has occasional issues clicking and typing some letters, and ABYSMAL speakers, degraded battery, etc.. So I have ordered a Swift and need to choose a ""distro"" to install on it. Having used first Mint & then Fedora, considering Debian. I don't think ""Acer"" is a bad manufacturer, but I wish I hadn't bought the Spin. I'll leave my initial review notes below, may help you if you are switching to Linux.

Original 4 star review: Encourage you to leave MS and try Linux. Also keyboard illumination timeout option in BIOS

After seveal years of increasing frustration with MS update methods, I made the jump to Linux on an Aspire and Swift. I wanted another Swift but couldn't find good price, got a Spin.

Three tips:
1) During setup, tell it you don't have internet if you want to get started without MS account.
2) When using F2 to get BIOS, some options are greyed out until you set a supervisor password. I think this is necessary to change boot order from Windows to USB.
3) To enable Linux installer to find the (nmve?) hard drive, hitting ""control s"" while in BIOS will un-grey a necessary option on the BIOS screen with ACSI or RAID or something like that.... Not sure if the supervisor password is necessary for the control s to work, because I was trying different things that didn't help, at overlapping times. You can search internets for more specifics (like whether secure boot needs off, or fast boot), but not knowing the ""control s"" thing set me back a couple hours.

Mint is one of the distros that's made to be comfortable for someone used to Windows, and that's how I made the jump from Windows, happy with it for several years. Needed kernel updates to get HDMI working was the only issue I remember being stuck on, and occasional mysterious issues with wifi needing restart. Trying to get further away from legacy, I am trying Fedora, which seems to be more true to Linux developers, rather than a pretend Windows. Howeer, I am NOT liking it, the GNOME ""desktop"" is maybe love it or hate it, but I am trying to learn it anyway.

The fact that you ""must"" have or create a MS account to start using this computer is outrageous, but 99% just say ""okay sure."" I hope you part ways with MS.

Oh yeah, if you want the keyboard to stay backlit when you turn on the backlight, rather than go dark, there is an option in BIOS. I don't remember finding the option in Windows or Linux settings. BiOS is easy - just hit F2 right after turning on computer. There is an option clearly related to keyboard backlight. If you don't like the change, you can go back and switch it. I'm sure it has effect on battery life, and wish there were variable times rather than ""on or off"" but it's worth trying. After all you can turn it off yourself with the F8 key.

B08F41S84R,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,7 April 2021,the United States,False,"In the picture, my old ASUS laptop is on the left, bought new for $600 in 2019. The new 2020 Lenovo on the right, for $499. I needed to replace my ASUS due to a manufacturing defect, and decided I needed something a little larger.

Comparing the Lenovo to the ASUS-

- Lenovo is much faster even though it has around the same specs as the ASUS. Loading webpages, opening programs, etc. is almost instant on the Lenovo.

- My biggest issue with my ASUS is that it would easily overheat if my screen was too bright or I overwhelmed the CPU fan and it made this awful grinding noise, I have yet to experience any overheating issues with the Lenovo even with running webpages, videos, games, and over programs at once.

- The keyboard buttons do look cheaper since they aren't backlit like on the ASUS, but I find the keyboard overall to be much easier to see and use on the Lenovo, the number pad on the right is a great addition as I use my laptop for work as well as gaming.

- The screen on the ASUS does seem to be better quality picture as it's more of a touchscreen glass, and the Lenovo screen is more of a traditional laptop screen. However, both touchscreen work just was well, and I feel like I found see as many finger marks as I do on the glass screen.

- The sound quality and loudness is much better on the Lenovo, like, super loud.

- Even though these two laptops are vastly different sizes, they weigh about the same. I find the larger screen on the Lenovo also easier to see, as the ASUS is only 13"".

All in all, I am pleasantly surprised with how well the laptop works. Along with the expedient shipping and care put into packaging. Good warranty terms as well. Over one month in and everything is still working as good as the first day, let's hope it keeps working that way!

B08DTJC9N7,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,17 July 2023,the United States,False,"Purchased quite a while ago from Amazon, the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 has proven to be an exceptional laptop that offers both versatility and robust performance. It's a device that bridges the gap between functionality, durability, and advanced tech features, distinguishing itself in a crowded market.

Upon unboxing, one cannot help but admire the build quality of the Spin 713. It's robust, meticulously crafted, and capable of withstanding the rigors of daily usage over a prolonged period. This aspect alone underscores the Spin 713 as a valuable long-term investment.

The Chromebook's display is a visual treat. The screen resolution, coupled with the vibrant colors and crisp imagery, offers an unparalleled viewing experience. Whether you're casually surfing the web, streaming media, or immersed in work, the visual quality is nothing short of spectacular.

Additionally, the 360-degree hinge allows the screen to flip all the way around, transforming the laptop into a tablet-like device. This feature enhances the laptop's flexibility, enabling you to adjust the display to suit various environments and use-cases, ranging from presentations to casual browsing or media consumption.

The Spin 713 also excels in terms of keyboard design. The backlit, ergonomic keyboard provides a comfortable typing experience, even in dim lighting conditions. The responsive keys, along with the tactile feedback, make long typing sessions a breeze.

Connectivity-wise, the device stands out with USB-C charging capability from both ports, offering unmatched convenience and adaptability in today's digital-centric world.

One of the laptop's most impressive features is its long-lasting and fast-charging battery. It provides enough power to get you through a busy day without needing a recharge, further enhancing its versatility and convenience.

However, perfection is elusive, and the Spin 713 has its share of flaws. The most glaring one is the subpar audio performance. The sound output is weak, muffled, and the overall audio quality is disappointing. Yet, this problem can be circumvented with the use of Bluetooth headphones or speakers, which noticeably improves the audio experience.

In conclusion, the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is a near-perfect device that offers a slight compromise on the audio front. Its high-quality build, impressive display, versatile design, and long-lasting battery life make it a highly recommendable choice for anyone in need of a reliable, feature-rich laptop. However, users who value audio quality might have to consider external solutions to make the most out of this device.

It was used by one person, never dropped or abused in any way. Used only at home--not taken out of the house or moved around. Called the company and they are saying I have to pay to have it fixed. What??? IT'S 9 MONTHS OLD. First and last Lenovo purchase. Junk!! When I had HP and had a problem they sent me packaging and label and fixed for free under the warranty. Lenovo had the nerve to ask me if I wanted to extend my warranty for more money when it didn't cover the manufacturer's defect I am experiencing now. Do they think I'm an idiot??? And the only person I could talk to couldn't let me talk to anyone else or give me another phone number. Going back to HP. I don't expect to never have a problem, but I expect a little help from the manufacturer. Anyone else have this problem??

UPDATE -- I sent the computer back to Lenovo and they fixed it free of charge. The person on the phone told me I would have to pay, even though it was within the warranty and it hadn't been dropped or abused in any way. So I am happier now than I was when I wrote the original review. Lenovo did make it right, and didn't charge me anything. Sure glad I didn't take it to Best Buy and pay to have it fixed like the rep from Lenovo suggested!! It's working fine now with the new screen and hinges. Wish the rep would have had better information.

B08DJXYMJL,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,14 November 2020,the United States,False,"Actualizo la reseña después de 10 meses de uso.
Sigo manteniendo los puntos en mi reseña original, el equipo después de muchísimas actualizaciones de Windows sigue portandose como el primer día de uso. Lo cual me da gusto porque me hace sentir que tome una decisión acertada con comprar este equipo.

El apartando de la batería resulta que era una función de Lenovo que tiene al equipo siempre alerta para un inicio instantáneo, no me agrada dicha función pero para suerte es algo que se puede desactivar si no te gusta. Con lo rápido que inicia este equipo con su SSD no lo veo necesario, prefiero extender la vida útil de mi batería al desactivar esto.

Lo que si me ha llamado la atención es que la tapa de la pantalla se partió por el lado de una bisagra, me tocó remplazar buscando por el número de serie del equipo y bueno, descubrí que la garantía solo es válida en USA, en el resto de los países te recomiendan un agente autorizado el cual cobra sus honorarios, así que ten esto presente si compras por Amazon desde cualquier otro país de América. Gracias a Dios conseguí la pieza original y mi laptop está como nueva sin ningún daño.

Estoy completamente satisfecho con el equipo, despues de una semana de uso y aqui una breve reseña espero le sirva a alguien si considera esta laptop.

#1: Estetica: No tiene una estetica brillante, un acabado mate en un color gris al que llamo ""Gris Lenovo"", la sensacion en ella es de un equipo profesional y una linea elegante sin ser muy vistoza, cosa que me gusta porque no me distrae su exterior, el logo de lenovo lo encuentras solo en un lado de sus caras y es bastante pequeño, marcos de la pantalla super reducidos apenas unos 5mm en los lados y 1 cm en la parte superior, mostrando solo la pantalla.

#2: Teclado retro iluminado: toda laptop con un valor minimo de 500$ en mi opinion debe incluir esta funcion, y es super util, el teclado se siente bien y no me equivoco, no incluye botones adicionales, una distribucion adecuada debo decir, para el trabajo de desarrollo que hago me va muy bien.

#3 Privacidad: La opcion de bloquear FISICAMENTE el lente de la camara con la pestaña me da un aire mas de privacidad y me es util, cuando en realidad no estoy para que me vean en video conferencias (truco).

#4 Velocidad de app: La carga e instalacion de aplicaciones es super rapida gracias a su disco solido, si alguien lee esta reseña buscando una laptop, en serio no compres laptop con HDD, es una tecnologia obsoleta en estos dias.

#5 Rendimiento: no me convencia la opcion de intel teniendo un atractivo modelo (mas costoso) con procesadores Ryzen, pero, aun tengo mis reservas con AMD en laptops, dado que he tenido 4 laptops con procesadores Athlon de AMD y todas tienen problemas en su tarjetas graficas, y me ha tocado hacer revaling en sus puntos frios, este procesador I5 no me ha dejado mal, incluso he editado videos en Adobe Premier sin problemas, programas como Xampp y entornos de trabajo con nodeJS procesan con exito todos los trabajos que coloco, photoshop, lightroom corren excelente, incluso Illustrator. con estos 16Gb de ram creo que chrome puede consumir lo que quiera y aun no experimento retraso en las operaciones.

#NO TODO ES PERFECTO. El unico apartado que encuentro un tanto dudoso es su bateria y es que cuando la apago me marca un porcentaje, y parece que se consume la bateria mientras esta apagada, aun es pronto para confirmar esto, pero aun asi he obtenido 7 horas y 32 minutos de autonomia con una carga. Por otro lado, su cargador es portatil pero su cable es muy corto, es de carga rapida pero me obliga a estar muy cerca de una toma para poder cargar y trabajar al mismo tiempo.

En definitva. UNA GRAN LAPTOP.

B08D92T45H,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,27 September 2023,the United States,False,"I bought this laptop to use for my robotic projects, mainly to use with VS Code and Arduino IDE. For that purpose, the product is great! I don't need anything else, connectivity is great, screen is great, the only thing I didn't like much was the trackpad, but nothing that a mouse can solve. For students or day-to-day users, this laptop is very suitable.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of my experience with the ASUS L410 MA-DB02:
- Performance: The Intel Celeron N4020 processor is not the fastest on the market, but it's enough for most basic tasks, such as browsing the web, checking email, and working on documents. I've also been able to use it to run VS Code and Arduino IDE without any problems.
- Display: The 14-inch FHD display is bright and clear, with good viewing angles. It's perfect for watching videos, working on projects, or just browsing the web.
- Keyboard and trackpad: The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the trackpad is responsive. However, I'm not a big fan of the trackpad's design. It's a bit small, and the buttons are integrated into the trackpad itself. I prefer to use a mouse, but the trackpad is perfectly usable if you don't mind the design.
- Battery life: The battery life is good, lasting around 6 hours on a single charge. This is more than enough for most people, but it's worth noting that the battery life will decrease if you're doing more demanding tasks, such as gaming or video editing.
- Portability: The laptop is very thin and light, making it easy to carry around. It's perfect for students who need to carry their laptop to class or for people who travel frequently.

Overall, I'm very happy with the ASUS L410 MA-DB02. It's a great value for students and day-to-day users. It's not the fastest laptop on the market, but it's fast enough for most basic tasks. It also has a good display, keyboard, trackpad, and battery life. If you're looking for a thin and light laptop that won't break the bank, I highly recommend the ASUS L410 MA-DB02.

B08D69XNG1,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,28 September 2020,the United States,False,"(Edited again ) After 3 month of use this are my impressions. So far its soo good so impressed with this product even after 3 months use. My model is with Amd ryzen 4700u.

Body : Laptop is made of aluminum and its very sturdy i will say its really really good for the price. I wish it had more colors as this black is matte and its a fingerprint magnet. And the 360° hinge also very good one.

Port : The port selection is good 2 normal USB(usb 2.0 and usb 3.2 gen 2), HDMI port, 1 usb Type-C, headphone jack, Kingston lock and charging port. I wish the Usb Type - C supported charging (it doesn't support charging and display port just for data transfer).

Display : Its good for most users and for my use its really good. It covers 60% SRGB ( if your photo or video editor who need 100% SRGB then go for others). The panel itself is good and have decent brightness level for my use i usually keep at 35% . And its touch screen and the touch response is soo good.

Performance : My model comes with Amd 4700U and the performance is very fast. Its soo good whatever you are doing it can handle very well. And the fan noise silent for normal use and if you doing heavy task the fan noise increases but it's under control . [(update) Also if u are doing light stuffs like reading a pdf or doing some light stuff the fan completely turns off. So its super silent for light users.] There is performance fan mode in MyAsus App which increases fan speed and noise for performance mode. For gaming i don't know i actually didn't use for gaming but it can handle some gaming i guess atleast from internet i saw it has a Nvidia Mx 150 like performance.

Ram : 8 GB Ram comes on board and the surprising thing is one slot is expandable. Out of the box it comes with 4GB sorted + 4GB in expandable sort. It can be upgraded upto 16 GB Ram so it can handle total of 20 GB. And this itself makes one of the best reason to go for it.

Storage : 512 GB SSD its fast and even that is upgradable.

Battery : (update) Now after driver updates and windows update My laptop goes 7-8 hrs normally and if using light stuffs it can go all the way upto 12-14 hrs. Thats a massive change after updates. So now u don't have to worry about charging. And the charger is very compact 45 W charger its small and it can fit in any bag.

Wifi card : My model comes with intel wifi 5 and its good. And if you want that's also upgradable. This laptop has so many user replaceable parts that make it best for customers even if you don't need to upgrade it can be useful for future needs.

Track pad : Its decent the tracking is very good but the button are not that great atleast for my taste.

Keyboard : The keyboard is good one with backlight. And it has very decent travel and i like the shortcut keys in function keys and you can change it when you want to use function keys(eg: f1) by just pressing FN +esc and it shows a small led color when its in Function button mode in FN button . The only thing i would say bad is that the ""back space key"" is little smaller than normal laptop.

Camera and Mic : Not good not bad its just a typical laptop camera but the mics are surprisingly good one.

Speakers : The speakers are good. Just goto Audio wizard app and change it into Movies it literally makes the speakers very good.

Pen : I am not a professional but from my usage for normal note taking usage it was good one. And it comes in box.

Security : It has fingerprint sensor and it so fast and it also supports windows hello.

Conclusion : (updated) This laptop is Excellent for the price of $699 for Amd ryzen 4700u. It balances out every thing for the price. And the value for money is 10/10. The only Downside is the stock of the product it just finishes so quickly. Otherwise this should be one of the popular laptops. For those who trying to buy this laptop. My advice is constantly check the product page because it sometimes suddenly comes to stock.

B08D69XNG1,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,24 December 2020,the United States,False,"Most of you are on Windows. If you are, you can pretend that this review has 5 stars because everything works fine on Windows, and Microsoft did a very good job with their touch UI. Hell, I'm even thinking of just giving it 5 stars.

The AMD Ryzen in there, along with its integrated graphics, is very fast. It beats my (old, but still kinda beefy) gaming pc in frames per second on Minecraft. Battery lasts forever. It's also very quiet. Under light loads, the fans don't spin at all, and when you start doing heavy stuff, they still spin quietly, and the whole thing stays cool.

When AMD dropped these processors this year, they made a statement that says nobody should have to pay extra to get a machine that doesn't suck.

I got used to the keyboard and touchscreen very quickly. I don't have like a million laptops to compare to, but I can say the keyboard is nice and comfortable. Build quality is metal so this will last you a long time.

And upgradable memory is really something you want. 8 GB might not be much in a couple years, but if you start running out, you can replace one of the 4GB sticks with a 16, giving you a very nice 20GB of ram. Many companies are moving towards soldered ram, which is sad.

So if you're running Windows, and want a 2 in 1 that runs quickly, this is the machine for you. You can stop reading the review here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But if you run Linux, and want something that you don't have to fiddle with to keep running without having to make sacrifices, you should look somewhere else. I hear good things about Lenovo, so you might have better luck over there.

I don't like Windows out of personal preference. I'm a developer, and while Linux Subsystem for Windows is getting better, it's nowhere near as good as running the real thing. I'm also a little paranoid when it comes to my privacy. I'm not gonna run an operating system that mines my data, and I wont take any of that ""nothing to hide, nothing to fear"" crap. I might as well go for a walk with no mask and no pants. There is nothing wrong with having something to hide. Valve's proton is getting better and better, and almost all my games run faster on Linux, so I game on Linux too.

Now, I knew what I was getting into. Linux touch UI is not the best. I'm running Ubuntu 20.10 (sorry its not arch). Some apps play nicely, mostly Gtk apps and Blink based browsers (Chromium, Chrome, and the one I use, Brave). But it's nowhere near as good as touch support on Windows. But, that's why I got this. I'm hoping to make touch support better on Linux, and I can't really do that if I don't have a touchscreen Linux machine.

Some other things also don't work out of the box. Some function keys don't work. Only volume, brightness, touchpad, keyboard backlight, and lock screen do. When you flip the screen over and use it like a tablet, the keyboard stays on, so you'll probably bump keys. The screen doesn't rotate like it does on Windows. I've seen some fixes going around but I haven't had the chance to install them so I can't tell you how well they work. They probably work well though.

Fingerprint only kinda works. On Windows, you can just tap and you're fine. On Linux, libfprint can't get a high enough resolution image, so you have to carefully swipe your finger over the reader. It works, but it takes a few tries to get right, so you're probably gonna be faster just typing your password.

But what really caught me off guard was that when you sleep it, the kernel hangs about 80% of the time when you wake it up. It doesn't stop the fans when you do sleep it either, so it will keep burning battery. You're better off setting it to keep running when you close the lid like I have, and shutting down if you wont use it for a while, which is fine because even with dm-crypt full disk encryption, it still boots very fast.

Turns out ASUS used some weird UEFI implementation that breaks away from the standards. Only Microsoft's kernel works with it. There's no documentation for where it breaks the standards, nor is there source code or even closed source binaries for it. It's all up to reverse engineering projects, which I will probably join as soon as I get the chance.

Everything else works great. AMD's graphics drivers run great on Linux, and if you choose the community driven open source alternative, those work good too. Wireless is more stable than my old laptop (Dell Latitude E6330).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before I end this review, I just want to say that ASUS does not support Linux, and they don't have to. Most people run Windows. ASUS wants to focus on making the more popular operating system run as good as possible. We made the choice to run something else. Even if their choice was for money, there's nothing wrong with that because they have families to feed.

We should not be toxic with them for making this choice. I see a lot of yall getting toxic with companies who don't support Linux. ASUS will probably change their mind if there were a lot more of us, but if the Linux community is known to be just a bunch of toxic nerds who throw a fit if some innocent company refuses to spend millions of dollars paying engineers and licensing code just to please like 19 people, we will never grow. If we don't like it, we need to either fix things ourselves or go somewhere else.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

edit: with ubuntu out of the box i later realized audio had a noticable delay. if you have the same problem, ill lay out some steps for those with little to no terminal experience

1. open a terminal
2. run the command `gedit admin:///etc/pulse/daemon.conf` without ` and type your password when it asks
4. go to the bottom of the file and add two new lines, `default-fragments = 5` and `default-fragment-size-msec = 2`
5. save and close the text editor
6. either go back to the terminal and run the command `pulseaudio -k`, or just reboot your computer

this is from https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Troubleshooting#Laggy_sound

ill be back with more fixes as i find them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

edit: 21.04 update just came out, which switches the default compositor from x11 to wayland. i was excited to move to wayland with its promises of better performance and security, but i got worse performance from it. i tried launching half life 2, and it locked up my whole display. game made sounds and everything but i couldnt even drop into a tty. so make sure at the login screen you click that gear icon and select ""ubuntu on x.org""

the login screen will still run on wayland, meaning you have both x11 and wayland running at the same time, which means nothing for speed once youre in x11 as far as i know, but it will slow down boot time a little bit and hold a little bit of extra ram. if you wanna get some of this ram back, you can edit the file /etc/gdm3/custom.conf

1. open a terminal, this time type `gedit admin:///etc/gdm3/custom.conf`
2. fine the line where it says ""# Uncomment the line below to force the login screen to use Xorg""
3. uncomment the line below it by removing the #
4. save and close it

on your next reboot, x11 should be all that runs. if you want you can uninstall wayland, but it shouldnt really take up too much space and i dont know how a system upgrade would react to that.

wayland will get better in the future though, its just not ready for this machine rn.

sleep is still broken sadly. a little bit more reliable but not for daily use.

The GTX 1650 is the base graphics card that has hdmi 2.0 and support HDR. The movies look great and everything works as advertised. Assume that the games I did play on it will play on much better settings than the laptop with the GTX 1050 graphics card I had so I will assume gaming will be ok but I got a Series X so I may never really know. As a Media storage device that output in 4k HDR it works great for that intended purpose. It has the ability to add a 2.5 inch drive and another m.2 drive so I should never run out of room.,0

Adding the 2nd drive is fairly easy. There are YouTube videos that you can watch to help you out if you're not so tech savvy.

Il prodotto era nel suo imballo originale, ma con il sigillo Lenovo rotto.
Il notebook all'interno tuttavia appariva assolutamente nuovo, senza alcun segno di usura.
Il S.O. preinstallato era Windows 10 Pro, ed è presente anche il pacchetto Office 2019 completo con licenza attiva.
La garanzia on-site risulta già partita da settembre 2021, quindi rimangono ancora 28 mesi.
Il venditore purtroppo non aveva altre informazioni, e si è subito dichiarato disponibile ad accettare il reso.
Dopo alcune perplessità ho deciso di tenere il notebook, vista la configurazione superiore e il prezzo conveniente (sotto i 700€).

Spero che quanto esposto possa essere utile.
Quanto sopra vale ovviamente solo per il modello venduto da Inamar Srl.
Se interessati, consiglio di chiedere conferma che gli esemplari ancora disponibili siano dello stesso lotto.

En sí la computadora funciona bien, he podido jugar casi todos los juegos a 60fps, el único detalle es que si juegas con batería se descarga muy rápido y los juegos van en un rendimiento ""regular"" entre 30 y 40 fps, y si tienes la laptop conectada podrás jugar sin ningún problema de rendimiento, obviamente que se le exige de más y es cuando los ventiladores empiezan a trabajar, ya es cuestión de que cada quién el uso que le dé, aparte de entretenerme un rato lo usaré para cuestiones escolares.

512 es muy poco, pero lo vale, pues siendo una SSD el equipo enciende en cuestión de segundos, la ventaja es que si quieres aumentar la capacidad lo puedes hacer más adelante.
Aunque es importada, sí tiene la letra Ñ, funciona como cualquier otro teclado.

Sin duda estoy muy contento con la compra, 10/10.

Listen, hear me out, I know that you're busy or have a short attention span, but it'll be worth it to read this WHOLE review. I'm gonna be critical about this, because I have a couple of things I love and absolutely hate about this product. So, stick around, and maybe I'll make you spend (or save) about $700. But seriously, please read till the end.
A bit about me, I’m a college student and I was looking for a new laptop cause my old one was garbage and was terrible for work.
Before I start, I'm going to explain my scoring system. The system will be based on a x/8 point system, in which I will convert to a x/5 stars (since I am only allowed to go up to 5 stars).

So, let’s begin this review!

Specifications: 3/3
CPU: 1
-It’s a Core i5-10210U, which isn’t that bad for a laptop like this. It can run numerous tabs and applications without problems and is enough to play non-GPU intensive games at 60FPS on medium – high settings.

RAM: 1
-8 GB of DDR4 RAM is enough to keep things running on your laptop without making it want to poop itself. It can run numerous tabs and applications without problems.

Storage: 1
It’s a 256 GB Solid State Drive (SSD). Loads things faster than I can blink, so it’s great when I have to open a lot of things for research, play, etc.

Components: 3/5
Audio: 1
-The audio is absolutely amazing. It’s crisp, clear, and you don’t need to buy a speaker to hear the thing on maximum volume. You can hear the bass clearly too, so it’s awesome for watching movies, listening to music, lectures, etc.

Screen: 1
-This laptop has absolutely great screen resolution that tops other 17-inch laptops out there.
“But PR,” I hear you ask. “Why is that? Don’t all 17-inch laptops have good resolu-“
Shhh, it’s okay, let me explain.
This laptop is 1920 x 1080 resolution, which basically means it has more pixels on the screen so you’ll get finer detail on your screen. This is unheard of, since most of the 17-inch laptop products on here and everywhere else have resolutions of only 1600 x 900.
This. Is. Madness.
Having a 1600 x 900 screen feels like you’re watching something on 720p. You can count the damn pixels, and it’s just ugly. This laptop right here, the one you’re looking to buy, is 1920 x 1080 resolution. It is one of the VERY FEW 17-inch laptops out there with GOOD screen resolution. That means no ugly pixel problems like the other laptops. So, you won’t have that problem. No pixel counting, just beautiful image and video.

Keyboard and trackpad: 1
-Keyboard and trackpad feel great. Since this laptop is bigger, it will take some time to get used to typing. But once you get a hang of it, you’ll be typing like a mad man. It’s comfortable to type and do work on.

Camera: 0
-Like all laptops that are made for work, I have yet to find one that has a good camera. I doubt that I ever will… But since this component is part of the laptop, I will still have review it.
Bottom line, the camera sucks. Very grainy even in good lighting, so don’t count on taking nice pics with this.

Battery: 0
-Terrible battery life. Laptop says 6 hours when fully charged. Then I just use Word and Powerpoint, but 15 minutes later it turns to 3 hours. But lives for another hour or two with power saver on, but I need to plug in after 4 hours, so still terrible when on the go. Recommend you always plug it in… SPEAKING OF ALWAYS KEEPING IT PLUGGED IN.

OH MY GOODNESS... WHERE DID ALL MY WORK GO!?: -2
-I don’t know where to begin. I’m busy working on multiple projects and I have all these notes that I have written down that I’ve spent days writing. All this time I’ve had my laptop plugged in. But one day I had it unplugged. The laptop said that it had a 6 hour’s before it runs out. I’m sitting there tapping away for 3 hours, and boom, Laptop shuts down. There was no indicator that the battery was getting low.
I’m like, “Oh what- ah, the battery died.”
So, I go plug it in, and leave it for a couple of minutes to charge it up. I come back and press the power button. The Lenovo logo pops up.
And then it doesn’t start up.
At this point, I’m confused. I do it again, and again. But the laptop just doesn’t want to go to the home screen.
So, there I am, looking throughout the internet to try and figure out what the hell is going on. Turns out, Lenovo has a big problem when starting up. And when it FINALLY goes to the auto-repair screen to REINSTALL WINDOWS 10, even the AUTO-REINSTALL HAS A PROBLEM.
There were two major problems here, the boot up issue and the windows 10 reinstallation issue. Amazon probably won’t let me post the links, so I’ll just leave it at that. Good luck finding a solution yourself. But let me tell you, it’ll make you feel like a computer engineer or software designer or something.
So, the entire process took me 2 hours to fix and I’m freaking out because I didn’t have time to get a new laptop because I’m a busy college student in med field.
Finally, the problem is fixed. And I think to myself, “That took forever… Don’t have more time to write notes, but I should at least look at them before I go to sle-“
And all my notes are gone. All. My. Notes. Are. GONE. All my hard work for the past couple of days have been deleted. I have to start all over, and I didn’t get any sleep that night.

Next time, I saved all my work onto a different hard drive, and I let my laptop die. Same problem.
So if you get this laptop... Always, ALWAYS keep this laptop plugged in, or pay the price like I did.

(TLDR I guess) Conclusion:
-Specs are good
-Components are alright
-Lenovo computers frequently have this problem, and I should’ve done a little more research before I bought this product.

Am I happy with this product? Kind of, the initial experience wasn’t super great. It makes it unreliable, since you can’t take it with you on the go because it just poops on itself and erases everything once it runs out of battery.
If you stay at home a lot, or if you know places where there are outlets, then this computer is for you. If not, then look at my recommendations at the end of this review.

Final score (Rounding up)
Specifications: 3/3
Components: 3/5
Deleting All My Files Always When it Runs out of Battery: -3 Stars
Total: 3 / 8 points.
Conversion to 5 Star System = 2 / 5 Stars

Recommendations
ASUS VivoBook 17.3"" FHD (1920 x1080) Display Laptop PC, AMD Ryzen 7 3700U Processor, 12GB DDR4, 512GB PCIe SSD, Bluetooth, Webcam, HDMI, WiFi, AMD Radeon RX Vega 10 Graphics, Windows 10 Home

These laptops specifications are on-par (if not better) than this laptop that I’m reviewing. I’m not sure if the audio quality is any good, but that’s for you to find out. These two recommendations are for the price range between $600 - $800.

B08B6F1NNR,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,24 March 2025,the United States,False,"I have never heard of the Lenovo brand before purchasing this laptop. I work remotely, but still go into the office at least once a week, so I needed something I could carry around. My last HP laptop started slowing down after 2 years. My husband bought me this as a replacement and we were both pleasantly surprised at how good it was! It’s super fast and still going strong after 3 years (bought in 2022, now 2025…time flies). I have been using laptops for over 20 years and let me tell you, this ain’t your dad’s bulky laptop from the Y2K era. Even though the screen is quite big (how I like it), the body is thin when closed and it doesn’t feel bulky at all. It fits perfectly in my backpack without taking up a lot of space. The keyboard feels good when I’m typing and makes that nice clickety clack sound. The touchscreen has been very useful during my business meetings and I love the gold color, which makes it look expensive, even though it was on the “cheaper” side. The battery life is pretty good. I get maybe 4-5 hours unplugged after fully charging. That’s more than enough for me because I always have my charger with me anyway. This is just a very rough estimate.

You’d think the “brand names” will give you a good quality laptop, but I have been very disappointed in some of them because they just don’t last very long. I will only buy Lenovo from now on. In fact, we bought 2 more Lenovos for our business because we know how good it is. I know this will start slowing down eventually as all computers do, but I will be purchasing another one when that happens. I’m hoping to get at least another year or 2 out of this one. I’ll update my review when it’s time for a replacement.

The Ryzen processor is great. Everything is very snappy and quick which makes it enjoyable to use. Pretty decent battery life for normal usage at around 7 hrs. I really like the touch screen. It is enjoyable to use.

My only con if I had to write one would be, it doesn't have that premium 'feel'. As in the it uses this hard plastic for most of the material. No finished metal as you would expect on the premium high priced products. But I knew I didn't care about that. For value of your dollar, I don't think you can beat this.

I needed something that was good for the following:
1. Taking Notes
2. Decent Display
3. Decent Battery Performance
4. Browsing the web.
5. Light activities such as word docs, excel, etc.
6. No gaming though I think this would be able to handle light gaming.

This laptop is great and I would definitely buy it again or recommend it to a friend. For the price, it is one of the best you can buy right now. Do your research and I think you find others agree.

Cheers,

B089W2MGD6,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,26 April 2021,the United States,False,"I love this laptop, after reading reviews and shopping around for a few weeks I decided the Lenovo Flex 5 was going to give me the most bang for my buck.
You won't find a better performing Ultrabook in the $800 range.
Equipped with an AMD 4700U 2ghz boosting to 4.1ghz 8 core 8 thread processor and 16gb of 3200mhz ram, this thing is a beast.
It'll play just about any game you throw at it at 60+fps
On top of that you get a solid keyboard, Lenovo's trusted FN+Q 3 mode Silent, Battery Saver, and Turbo hotkey functions.
A rigid frame, a great trackpad, a fingerprint reader, 720p webcam with privacy lens, and great sounding speakers considering they're cased inside of a 14 inch Ultrabook.
While I do love this laptop I will admit that it's not perfect.
The battery life, while advertised at 10 hours, on this model works out to around 7 - 7.5 hours of moderate use. The models with the 4500u possessors should get closer to 8-9 hour battery life however I've only tested the 4700U model.
The second caveat is the screen, a 1080p 60hz Touchscreen IPS, while for what it is this screen looks very nice and is very responsive to the touch, It doesn't get incredibly bright and while it does support HDR playback the screen itself is not HDR and only reaches a brightness of around 250 nits.
Another thing worth mentioning is the built in wireless card is wifi 5, however it is swappable, wifi 6e cards are only around $40 so I'd recommend swapping that out if you do decide to purchase this laptop, you mite also want to pick up the optional charger, the one that comes with the laptop uses its only USBC port, while the optional charger plugs into a charger port.
Also there is only one M.2 slot so if you want more memory you'll want to clone and swap the hard drive.
All in all I think this is a great laptop and I'm looking forward to using is for many years to come.

I bought myself a cheap Celeron chromebook a few years back for around $150. Boy is this a change. This machine (even the cheapest m3 version) is a suitable replacement for a Mac or PC, and in some ways even superior. If you have a 100% browser based workflow, it's seriously time to think about going full Chrome. The speed, low power consumption, and battery life are unbelievable in comparison to a full OS.

A few minor caveats. The backlit keys are indeed worthless since they aren't black and there's no contrast with the backlighting. The speakers are on the bottom of the case, which mutes the sound somewhat. Annnnnd, that's about it. The touchscreen is a hair less responsive than an iPad for drawing. Everything else is really impressive. I'm a longtime Mac user and this has the feel of a brand new MacBook Air at 2.5-3x the price.

I’ve played games such as GTA5, The Witcher 3 and Assassins Creed Odyssey to name a few and got a perfect gaming experience from it. Slight downside is the battery life. On battery with sound and full backlight you might get 2-4 hour of battery life depending on the task you are doing. With little to no sound and a slightly dimmer backlight you should see around 4-6 hours of battery life. I dropped battery life by a star but other than that, it’s the perfect high tier gaming laptop. Highly recommended",0

The processor, graphics card, and RAM are sufficient for working with software like Inventor or CAD programs and having other tabs open. The keyboard is amazing, as you can personalize it. The problems are the battery and the temperature. The battery is bad because it discharges so fast (in normal use, almost in 1 hour and twenty minutes). Also, you need to have the fans at high frequencies to keep the computer at a decent temperature (I mean 50°C) instead of it reaching 95°C (when you charge it), which can result in damage.

After a year and two months of fair use, i had a short circuit in the motherboard and will need to get a replacement. According to my tech, this was this due to a malfunction in the components of the motherboard and not due to its use, most likely cheap components. I had fans, ac/dc regulators and every thing to avoid overheating but that didn’t help.

I have had other brands and never experienced something alike. My recommendation is, pay a little more but go with a more prestigious brand.

Good things about this laptop( while it was working), extremely fast, all games worked flawlessly with no lags, good at multitasking in business / school apps, very upgradeable and easy to do it, slim design and fans not so noisy.

Deltas: Keep in mind this laptop will last one or two years and you cannot rely on it. Camera is below average, sound speakers average, poor battery life, very heavy charger, does not have fingerprint reader, does not have firewire port.

B0883G4WJR,Anonyme,2.0,Sans titre,17 February 2023,the United States,False,"TL;DR: Do NOT buy this laptop. It's NOT properly compatible with the latest version of Windows 10/11 and will corrupt/erase your files and will constantly crash/blue screen on you.

I bought this laptop as a back-up to my PC at the height of covid. In the end I barely used it, but kept it as it had nice features. Problems started when it got the latest Windows update. One day I booted it up after the update and all my files and programs were gone... It's as if the laptop got a complete clean install of Windows. Luckily I didn't have many important files on it. I looked it up and apparently the drivers aren't regularly kept up to date by Acer so you risk this and more when updating Windows.

I thought it was a virus at first so I tried scanning using Windows Defender. Problem is the laptop always hangs if I try to do a full scan. So I'm stuck using quick scan only. I used command lines to check and fix any corruptions but it didn't fix anything.

Other things started happening such as the laptop randomly restarting, BSODs with different error codes every time it happens. And now, it refuses to boot up. Every time I press the power button, it hangs on the Predator logo. The laptop's a complete dud now. This all started happening conveniently after the warranty expired too. Wonderful.

im able to max out everything and get good frames per second!!!
it runs super cool doesnt even get that hot
i can also game using the speakers as they get loud and can fill up the room very easily.
this is a huge laptop which would replace my desktop as it is always stationed and constantly moving around i dont have space to station a desktop and i can bring this laptop with me everywhere i go
from the bedroom to the living room and take it with me on the go.

this laptop is very nicely build with aluminium metal and is beautiful.

the only negative thing about this product is the battery life really really sucks (see pic included with review) i dont know if i got a defective unit but my battery last only a hour and a half just browsing the web and streaming youtube videos.
for 3200 the battery life is horrible and they claim battery life suppose to last 4 hours which it does not only get an hour and a half of battery and than it goes completely dead. and i have the brightness on low all the time.

also the key board to type on this isnt so great as i causes a lot of typos. if your going to be typing a lot on this laptop ur going to be having a lot of typos.
if ur using this just to browse the web and stream video content and strictly game on this u should be fine.

other than the battery life of 1.5 hours and the key Boards kind of small to type its an amazing laptop and amazing build quality.
if your used to typing on a macbook ur going to hate the keyboard as it gets annoying have to correct the typos since the keys are so close to each other and run failry small considering how big the body is.

also upgrade ur SSD because after installing 3 to 4 games i maxed out the memory on the hard drive lol.
for the mean time im using a external 8TB hard drive. going to upgrade to a 2TB on the vacant slot that's easily up gradable.

B087KXDMNS,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,29 August 2020,the United States,False,"Absolutely unbelievable. Every laptop I’ve had from razer has had some issue that fell under warranty. I assumed that the stealth blades weren’t their highest end products so perhaps that was the issue. Now I spent $4300 on this/ their top of the line 2800 super max — this 17” pro and the screen completely died within the first 30 days!!!! I adjusted the angle of the screen slightly and the screen went black. I returned it to the working position and the screen was visible. I moved it back to the black screen position — and now it won’t turn on for any number of resets and angle readjustment! It was about a 1” arc range that triggered the failure in a totally normal use angle.

I use this machine for my work and now I can’t use it!!! And their RMA process takes over a month!!!! (I know because of my 2 other razer laptops that had issues within weeks of owning).

This is entirely unacceptable. Clearly their entire line has problems. I will never take a risk on these nor give them the benefit of the doubt again.

Further, their customer service is the biggest headache of circular outsourced customer service nonsense I’ve ever experienced in my life. It took weeks to even get an rma approval on my first two laptops. I’m not looking forward to this next headache.

UPDATE: 3 days after I opened my support ticket with razer I still got no response... and instead received a message telling me that I hadn’t responded to the ticket and it was going to be closed! They never reached out or replied to me! Only let their automated system try to end the ticket because they completely refused to even read (or respond to) my ticket!!! Pathetic on the level of fraud! Absolutely ignored fulfilling their advertised warranty!

B087KXDMNS,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,6 September 2020,the United States,False,"I am going to compare this to the Dell XPS 17 and I will keep it short.
I wanted to like the Razer Blade as it is very powerful and the chassis is built so well. I really wanted to keep it.
The good:
It is powerful and you can play most games at high frame rates.
The RGB keyboard is really cool, almost infinitely variable lighting.
Sound is pretty good and nice 120Hz, 4K touch screen.
The bad:
The keyboard is terrible for typing (you will see this on many reviews and it is true). The worst thing is the row with the shift key is ""shifted"" to the left (see picture). Look at any other keyboard and the keys in that row are centered between the keys in the row above, but not on the Razer. Why did Razer feel the need to reinvent this?
This is the real deal-breaker for me. The Dell has a terrific keyboard.
Windows Hello will not recognize me half the time. The Dell is excellent at signing you in without any issue, no matter if I am wearing a hat, sitting slightly off center, etc.
This is a heavy beast. The Dell is more than 1.5 pounds lighter if you include the power supply.
The power port is just ridiculous. You can work with it, but why? You can plug the Dell in on either side.
The Dell has the same CPU, but it is allowed to work harder. It benchmarks better than the Razer Blade.
The Dell's 4K screen is only 60 HZ but it has inkier blacks and looks better. It also has almost no bezel at the bottom of the screen.
Did I mention that the Dell is quite a bit smaller?
Fingerprint magnet-no kidding, the Dell still looks new.
$1000 more than the Dell. Only real difference being the RGB keyboard and the 2080. If you are avid gamer then it may be worth it. I prefer a laptop that is more of an all-rounder.

B08777BH1B,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,25 November 2020,the United States,False,"I just recently purchased the Acer Nitro 5 Core-i7 with 15.6 display screen as well as the mouse. The computer is awesome for gaming because you get really good frame rates in games like Minecraft, as well as Fortnite. However, it does seem to be inconsistent at some points because it can have really good frame rates at some point but really poor framerates at other times. I don't really know the reasoning behind this, these are just my observations. My gameplay in Minecraft (in the max settings), I got around 120-200 FPS and in Fortnite (in the max settings), I got around 100-160 FPS. When I ran Fortnite, after a few minutes of playing, the fan started to get noticeably louder and louder which I don't mind but just another observation. It does get quite loud but I just increase the volume so the noise is pretty much cancelled out. I really enjoy gaming with this computer but the battery life only goes for at least two hours until you have to charge it while playing. Another thing I've noticed with this computer is that the some of the keys in the keyboard seems somewhat tough to press on. If you do decide to get this gaming laptop, expect to apply more force than usual onto the keyboard because some of the keys can be stuck. Other than these two things (battery life and keyboard), this is an excellent gaming computer, would definitely invest into something like this again.

This PC has 8GB of RAM and a 512GB HD. The Core i5 processor is very fast. Touchpad is very comfortable to use and the keyboard is great. It reminds me a lot of my former Macbook in terms of design. The backlit keyboard is a huge plus and the 10-key is small so it doesn't get in the way. The small bezels help reduce the size while still getting an acceptable screen size. Not the lightest, but it isn't heavy.

The screen quality isn't amazing amazing, but is definitely good. Battery life is a 7/10 and the size of the charger adapter is a bit clunky.

B086P6THG6,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,28 December 2020,the United States,False,"The product came in great condition and had very secure packaging. The laptop overall was a great computer but the trackpad is small, so you need to purchase a separate mouse in order for the laptop to work at its fastest. At some point the trackpad didn't work anymore and the curser wouldn't show up, but the separate mouse I purchased for a couple of dollars worked perfectly fine. The battery life overall is ok and is considered short compared to other laptops that can be purchased for the same price. The material of the laptop was very smudgy and fingerprints could easily be seen from the case. The laptop size overall was pretty bulky and heavy with a small screen. The length of the screen was large but the width was pretty small.
The multitasking feature works very well and I am very happy with how it functions. When you drag a tab to the second smaller screen, it sizes it perfectly so that you can see the tab and use it easily. You can have up the three tabs on the bottom screen and even more on the top. A function that I found to be very useful was how you could resize, drag, and drop the different tabs in different locations of the laptop. It was great for multitasking and I have no complaints in that area of the laptop. The touchscreen was like any other and works well with stylists.

B086M8PQYR,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,22 September 2020,the United States,False,"Overall great gaming laptop. Bought it as a mobile workstation with gaming potential (in that order). So far is blasting fast for everyday use and every game i've tried runs +30 FPS on the best settings. I've haven't been able to reach 300 FPS in any game so the 300Hz display is a bit of an overkill.
The built quality is amazing, a bit sharp on the edges (I was used to a macbook) and feels sturdy.

PROS:
- It is a beast hiding on a very sober design. Besides the green logo on the back of the display, you wouldn't know its a gaming laptop, which is great if you plan using it on a formal workplace (which is my case).
- The RGB keyboard is a great addition if you take the time to really configure the different lightning options for each app.

CONS:
- It gets HOT. I cannot use it on the bed/lap while playing any casual game (the temperature its ok/mildly unconfortable for browsing the internet though).
- The proprietary charger port seems to be designed to be a tight fit which makes you feel you are scratching the aluminum (sometimes you are).
- Speakers are bad, super bad. I didn't expect them to sound good, but they are not useful for anything else but conferencing.
- Expensive, here you are paying for a simplistic gaming design, premium materials and awesome thermal performance on a thin laptop.

Semi-CON:
- The battery life is somewhere around 3 hours. Not bad for a gaming laptop, but for a mobile workstation means you will need to carry a charger wherever you go. I solved it by using a 100W USB C charger for moving around instead of the bulky 230W original charger, but you wont be able to achieve peak performance this way.

B086M8PQYR,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,30 May 2021,the United States,False,"Took a gamble and bought ""Used - Very Good"" and the condition was basically perfect.
Been using for 4 months and so far only had a few ""issues"" that were resolved (by me).
1. Heard electric whine coming from laptop. Was concerned at first but noticed my other laptops also do it... seems normal for laptops.
2. Games were suddenly very sluggish with huge fps drops. I just had to update the GPU drivers and it was fixed. (I didnt think to do this right away). Mainly play csgo and easily run at 300fps. Sometimes play apex and have no issues except it cant run apex at 150fps+.
3. Speaking of Apex... the laptop gets VERY hot for intense games. I plug external monitor+mouse+keyboard so its not a big issue but it WILL heat up your room. The room temperature increase is noticeable. I dont think it's feasible to play on the laptop keyboard when playing something like Apex since the laptop gets too hot. My palms get sweaty and overall not a pleasant experience. The vapor cooling seems to work pretty well though... even when gaming for 10hours+ at high temps I dont get performance drops which is amazing imo. I considered getting a fan that sits under the laptop but it doesnt seem necessary. We'll see how it holds up over time.
4. One day, bluetooth stopped working entirely. It just disappeared... even from Device Manager. I googled the issue and a BIOS reset fixed it.

PROS:
Build quality feels great. Impressed by it. Almost at mbp level.
Great performance. I've played csgo, apex, gtav, mordhau, and valorant all with no issues.
Screen looks pretty good. Not mbp level but better than average laptop screen imo. I'd imagine the 4k 60hz looks even better. (higher refresh rates monitors almost always look worse than lower rate picture-focused monitors)
Does not come with a bunch of bloatware. (i hate bloatware w a passion)

CONS:
The laptop keyboard is HORRIBLE. Travel distance is so low it's annoying to use.
You must install their proprietary razer software to customize the keyboard lighting.
Gets VERY hot.
Brand doesnt seem to have a good reputation for longevity so I do worry that it will randomly die on me one day.
Logo on the lid is very ugly in my opinion.
Wish it had one more usb c port.

Overall, it's an extremely difficult task to compete with Apple and I'm happy that Razer put effort into creating a high end product that feels fairly polished. Four months in and I'm pleased with my purchase.
Some misc thoughts... I dont think it was necessary for the screen to go up to 300hz... 240 is good enough imo... Would be nice if, for future versions, they got rid of the huge charger and made it usb c charge. Would be nice if I could buy a version with no webcam and they got rid of the top bezel.

B086M8PQYR,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,20 October 2021,the United States,False,"The laptop is just great. Fells like a hight quality build. Screen has a beautiful display. RGB Chroma makes it look cool. Most importantly it runs most games out there at 1920 x 1080 resolution on ultra high settings with no noticeable FPS drops. Yes it does get hot when running games at those settings but if you play it in an A/C cooled room, connected to a TV via HDMI, it doesnt get as hot. And its How I always used the laptop

That is also why my review is a 2 Star rating. In less than one year the HDMI port on my laptop stopped working. The computer does detect the TV and lets me assign a resolution for it but theres no display on my TV. Its funny that one should pay over $2000 on a computer for it to start breaking apart in less than a year. After trying litterally every troubleshooting step I could find and contacting Razer they decided I should send the computer for repair. And as of now Im waiting for them to reply to me. Havent heard from them since before yesterday.

I will update the review as the story develops. But as of now I could not justify their ultra expensive release prices for their products if they are not even going to outlast the manufacturers warranty.

Update 1: Razer will sell their products to Puerto Rico customers. Even on their webise they will ship them to Puerto Rico. Even Best Buy stores in the island sell Razer products. But in case of a warranty claim. If the product needs to be sent for repairs/replacement, it has to be sent first to an address in the USA so it can then be sent to Razer.

This might also apply to any US territory. So, dear purchaser please consider it seriously before purchasing from Razer. Specially if you live in a US territory like Puerto Rico.

Update 2: It turns out that Razer does offer direct warranty support to Puerto Rico. Seems like some CSR were misinformed. In the end I was able to send the faulty laptop to razer and they sent if back repaired. Had to wait about a week which ia not that bad.

Im giving it a 3 star review because while my problem was resolved is the 1st time I had a new laptop go bad on me in less that a year, that and the misinformation on behalf of customer service.

Overall Razer has cool looking products but theres always a chance of buying something that might not last. If its under warranty then youre covered.

At the time I thought, eh, it's not that important. No. The touchpad size and location may make this a good laptop for gaming, but it is ABYSMAL if you have to do a lot of typing. Multiple times per writing session, and almost every single time I ctrl+I or ctrl+b to bold or italicize text, the palm of my hand will brush the touchpad and move it further up in the document somewhere, which stops me mid-flow because I have to delete the letters I might have typed somewhere else and move the cursor back to the end of the document. Every day. Multiple times per day. I have looked to see if there's a way to disable a portion of the touch pad more than once, because this issue is so frustrating and obnoxious, but so far no luck.

This would have been a dealbreaker, if I had known it ahead of time. It's not a bad laptop otherwise, especially for the price, but it you do a lot of typing, this WILL be constant problem that you will not adjust to and will not go away.",0

B0869L1326,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,29 October 2020,the United States,False,"Item #1 below is focused on Windows 10 S Mode. I didn't intend to write so much about S Mode, but I did so and thus it is there for you to consider. The rest of the comments made are about the Asus laptop itself.

1.) I find Windows 10 S Mode to be excellent. The more I use it, the more I like it. {I've used S Mode on other devices for about 8-months.) You can exit S Mode easily, but I say it is really an awesome and an under rated OS. It virtually blocks malware, period. You can't tell the laptop is in S Mode unless you try to install something from outside of the Windows Store. Unless you are a gamer or need some special program, S Mode should be considered. It can save you a lot of concern about being compromised by hacking, which is becoming more of a concern of late, especially with the increase in sophistication in attacks from nation states and organized crime. Yep, I'm a techy with an opposing view to the techie press. Seems they mostly trash Windows 10 S Mode, but they rarely seem to articulate the benefits of S Mode. I think Microsoft should do a better job of marketing the OS. Why they don't is beyond me.

I upgraded from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro via the Windows Store. I then as an admin joined this device to Office 365's Intune. I realize the tech world seems to talk down Windows 10 S Mode, but I am a contrarian and think it is outstanding. Also, S Mode requires way less Windows updates than regular Windows so, again, I am a fan. As an admin, I don't need to concern myself with updates as much. This OS is really hard to compromise.

2.) This laptop is an outstanding value for the price. It has and i3 Intel processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD hard drive. Really, this is perfect configuration for the average business or college user. The performance is excellent for what it is equipped with. The i3 Intel chip works a lot better than most people realize. Even running when streaming video, it does well.

3.) The display is adequate for business use. If you are a gamer or watching lots of video, it will likely be somewhat disappointing, good displays cost. You don't usually get something for nothing. Again, the display is adequate for what it is. Although the viewing angles are tight, I've seen other reviewers comments about the display and find their comments exaggerated and I wonder what they expect for a laptop that costs less than $500. Let me add that I have worked on a lot of PCs over the years, and I can tell you this display is good, but not great. However, if you want a premium display, like I said earlier, you need to pay for it. Again, this display is good enough for general use.

4.) The ports provided are the latest version of each type provided. Again, this laptop is a great value for the cost.

5.) The backlit keyboard is really good. I like the feel of the keys, and I like the numeric pad. The keyboard is quiet and comfortable to type on.

6.) The laptop's body/frame. Is plastic. Looks pretty darn good given the price of the unit. However, I am unsure as to how strong the body is should the laptop take a fall. I'm not doing a drop-test on this one because I have pay for it if I break it, but again, the price point of this laptop gives you a pretty darn good device for the price.

CONCLUSION: A surprisingly great laptop for the under $500 price charged and will be appreciated by a general or average user. (Suggestion: Keep the device in S Mode and save yourself malware and update headaches.)

B0865THZCL,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,8 January 2021,Mexico,False,"Esta computadora es más que perfecta por el precio que ofrece.

Diseño: El diseño es muy bonito, más de lo que pensé ya que en las fotos se me hacía algo tosca. Las luces RGB del teclado son muy bonitas, así como el diseño exterior.

Performance: Gracias a su SSD y procesador es un cohete, prende en menos de un minuto y abre casi todo de manera inmediata.

Juegos: Hasta ahora me ha corrido todos los juegos de manera estable, rebasando los 60 fps. A decir verdad, veo difícil que alcance los 144 fps en algún juego y use la capacidad completa de su pantalla, pero sin problemas mantiene 100 fps +/- en muchos. El único detalle es que hasta con el juego más pequeño prende los ventiladores al máximo y hace mucho ruido. La parte buena es que mantiene la computadora con buena temperatura, ya que el procesador Y GPU se mantiene en 50C +/- en la mayoría de los casos. Me atrevo a decir que corre cualquier juego sin problemas a 50fps o más.

Batería: este punto probablemente es el más débil de cualquier laptop gamer, capando el performance no llega a mas de 2 horas de juego o 4 horas de entretenimiento en general. He leído y la mayoría de las laptop gamer tienen un performance similar, pero si buscas una computadora con buena autonómica definitivamente no es buena opción. La pantalla, gpu y rgb la secan muy rápido (puedes capar estas cosas cuando usas la batería para que dure más).

Resumen: por el precio que la compré, no tiene rival. Laptops con peores o specs similares estaban más caras. Si quieres jugar cualquier cosa de manera decente sin llegar a lo extraordinario es tu mejor opción.

Bonus: la descripción no lo dice, pero tiene un puerto extra de RAM para expandirla fácilmente. Asimismo tiene una bahía con un puerto SATA III (incluye el cable) para ponerle un segundo HDD/SSD, esto hace que mejorar la computadora sea fácil y rápido. Yo recomendaría aumentarle la RAM a 16gb (agregar 8gb) para tener la mejor experiencia en juegos, así como para hacer streaming de manera más estable si es lo que pretenden. La capacidad interna también se me hace muy limitada si piensas tener muchos juegos o guardar mucho multimedia (viene con 400gb libres), aumentarla no sería mala idea.

Obvio el teclado rgb es un gran atractivo y super bonito; que esté en inglés es irrelevante cuando te acostumbras.
Además, es un equipo relativamente ligero.

B0865SCD6L,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,19 September 2020,Canada,False,"You can't beat the price of this laptop for its specs. It's been able to handle pretty much whatever I've thrown at it. Speakers sound good with great volume range and monitor is what you'd expect.

This is an IPS monitor so expect to see the IPS glow - this is a limitation of the technology and can NEVER be prevented. Know the difference between that and a backlight bleed. The glow is slightly visible in a dark environment/black screen on the corners of the screen. A backlight bleed is a manufacturing defect and will be much more visible and localized to one area of the screen.

The unit I received did not have a backlight bleed. I suspect one of the reviewers just received a faulty unit.

Some things to be aware of:

No USB-C, ports are all on left side with hdmi, 1 usb 2.0 and 2 usb 3.0

Use the included Armoury crate software to change fan/cpu profiles. Silent is good for general day to day tasks. Laptop fans are very quiet in this mode. Performance is for more intensive applications like video editing. Fans would be audible but I've found the house average compared to other laptops under heavy load.

Finally Turbo Mode - don't put it in this mode unless you think you really need it. Your cpu state will be boosted and fans sound like a jet engine

DO NOT close the laptop lid when under heavy load (for example, if you have an external monitor attached). Although you can put in windows to prevent sleeping, ASUS' firmware has an override to sleep if it's under heavy load/high temps. They did this because there's a vent that's being blocked when lid is closed.

The trade-off of the vent design though is that the keyboard area remains comfortably cool under load and the battery area stays at pretty much room temperature.

Battery life is a bit short due to the smaller pack they've chosenz but you can't really expect much from a gaming laptop. If you use this plugged in most days, go into my Asus app and change the battery setting to only charge up to 60 percent. This will save your battery in the long run.

Lighting is not customizable per key, and the tweaks you can do are very limited. Aura is not compatible with the keyboard.

B0865SCD6L,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,28 November 2020,the United States,False,"Alright, so I just wanted to write a review for this product, because I don't think there any other one. First things first - I LOVE this computer. To put it blatantly, it gets the job done, and it does it well! To those who might expect a laptop that will be able to play every game currently avaliable at 120, you'll be dissapointed. To put it into perspective, I can play Modern Warfare 2019 at 60 FPS on high settings with ray tracing. For Cold War, I can play it at 40-50 on high settings without ray tracing (As of writing this on 11/27/2020, the game only being out for little more than a week, that's probably subject to change) But just about any game before that, you can expect modest to great results depending on which game. My only 2 complaints about it, is the battery life, and storage space. Since it is a laptop, it can get pretty hard to try and cram as much battery life into it without sacrificing space for other components. But, that isn't the case with this one. You almost ALWAYS have to have it plugged in when doing anything on it. I can get about 4-5 hours of just regular usage (like browsing and watching YouTube, typing word documents, ect) But if you want to play a game on this, you HAVE TO play it plugged in. It doesn't inconvenience me personally, but I know for other people it might be a different story. Second complaint is how little 512GB SSD feels when you actually use it. For example, for just about any AAA game, expect to use up about 100-200GB of space - PER GAME. So either you are going to have to only have about 2-3 AAA games all at once, or only have 1-2 AAA games, and some other indie games. Other than that, this is a SOLID package. This is my first computer I've ever owned, and safe to say this is a great starting point for those who want to get introduced into gaming on a computer, without dropping 2000-3000 on a PC, moniter, mouse and keyboard, ect.

TLDR: It gets the job done well enough. 4-5 hours of regular usage, HAVE TO leave it plugged in to game without it dying on you quickly. You have about 490Gb of usuable space, not counting the fact that it's an SSD, which means you have to leave a portion of it unused for it to be efficient. Other than that, great introduction into PC gaming world without having to spend life's savings on a killer PC.

B0865SCD6L,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,12 July 2020,Canada,False,"First things first. I was a little hesitant to order this, as it was not in stock, and every time I checked, the ""In Stock"" date was different. When I ordered this July 4th for example, its in stock was Aug 5. I decided for the price and the components in the laptop, it was worth the wait. I woke up July 12th and the laptop was at my place, so don't be too scared off by the ""In Stock"" date, it was only 8 days from order to delivery for me (and I ordered late at night, so I would only consider this to be 7 days).

The system came exactly as expected. No unexpected changes to the hardware. Setup was quick, maybe about 10 minutes and I was ready to start using it. I installed Steam and Battlenet right away so that I could test some games. The keyboard and trackpad work well, it does throw me off that the track pad right and left buttons aren't raised or even separated from the trackpad, so without looking sometimes I click when I dont want to, or dont click when i want to. By default there is no scroll on the side of the track pad which I was looking for, but I have to play with the settings still.

EDIT: There is 1 discrepancy that I identified during testing. The RAM clock speed is NOT 2666 Mhz as the description says. I noticed it was running at 2400 Mhz, and opening the case and taking the chip information and going to the vendor documentation, the RAM i have is definitely 2400 Mhz (not 2666 running slower, which I first thought it might have been)

Very little bloatware which is nice on a laptop. The Asus app is somewhat useful so I may leave it for now.

Noise wise, it definitely isn't quiet when playing Modern Warfare, but I expect that from a gaming laptop with a higher end graphics card. There is a lot of heat to get out, and I understand that thats going to make some noise.

I'll update this review after I have some time to play some games, however I did install COD Modern Warfare and play a level and it was gorgeous and ran very smoothly at high settings. The first level loaded very slowly, but after I quit and allowed the game to install its shaders, I tried the embassy level and it loaded in 11 seconds, which is maybe a little faster than my desktop.Ray Tracing wasn't enabled during my first playthrough, but I will adjust the settings after I update the drivers.

Update: I played a few hours of Call Of Duty Modern Warfare with Ray Tracing enabled, and high-Max video settings. The FPS averaged 60, with spikes around 80, and lows around 45. Very impressed, and it looked gorgeous! The laptop definitely was putting out a ton of heat, and the fans were very loud. The loudness doesn't bother me as mentioned, but it could bug others.

The ASUS app allows you to select from 4 profiles and displays the strengths and weaknesses of each. For example setting it to the Turbo profile, indicates that noise will be high (as well as performance). When playing lower end games, the fan doesn't kick up nearly as much, and when browsing internet/streaming videos, the fan was nearly silent.

I'll keep updating as I use this laptop. The RAM is only a single stick, and there is room for a 2.5"" SATA HD/SSD, so I bought another stick of RAM (16 gigs), and a 2.5"" SSD that arrives today. I know there is debate about single channel/dual channel memory performance increases, however with the VEGA integrated graphics processor sharing RAM with the system, I wanted to ensure I had extra (note the system switches to the 2060, when playing games)

B0865RZR9S,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,30 September 2020,the United States,False,"It's honestly irritating to see one of the top reviews (the one with all the pictures) complaining about the panel. It's kinda like buying a pickup truck then saying it's not as fast as a sports car. I'll just call it as it is - you're an absolute idiot if you think that this laptop could have the best processor, graphics, display, and battery for only $1k. If this laptop were $3k, I would say the concerns were warranted. It's not.

This laptop is an absolute steal for its value proposition. The processor is mind blowing. The battery life is better than you could find in even thin and light form factor laptops from years ago - in a gaming laptop. The video card plays basically anything I can throw at it, and the display is far better than anything on the market just a few years back. It manages to do all of this for only $1200.

Yes, I have seen some ghosting when looking for it. Yes, my 144hz desktop monitor has better response times. Yes, my color calibrated 60hz dell desktop monitor I got specifically for video editing has far better color accuracy. In the end though, does that matter? Would you rather have had those things and paid $2-3k for this?

When a laptop with this level of value is no longer an option in future release cycles, people will only have themselves to blame. I challenge anyone saying this laptop sucks to find something better for the same price.

The good, when it doesn't interrupt me.. it does rock as a gaming laptop. I like the build, its solid, I like the keyboard feel and the backlit keys. The screen hinge is solid and the so far, no pixalation.

The bad - Random black screen. In use, not in use, it doesn't matter. Different program, games, web browers... it doesn't matter. The screen goes black and I can can do nothing to get it to come back on except, hard power off and reboot. I have even tried all the fixes on tech forums. Read the forums, I am not the only one with this issue. I don't believe this is a windows or GPU driver issue, I believe it is a hardware issue or an Asus overlay issue. Not as frequent, but I have blue screened 4 times in 60 days and not on the same program. My windows 10 on a self built machine has never blue screened. I have tried to get ahold of Asus support, but something always seems to come up that I have have drop the hold 45-60 minutes in. So, perhaps if I can ever get ahold of someone, they might be able to fix the issue, however, I don't see anything on their support web site, so I am not holding my breath.

Update in Mar 2021 - The Blue Screen issue seems to have disappeared. The frequency of the black screen has reduced but not gone away completely. Instead of black screen 3-4 times a day, it is only happening about 1-2 times a day now. I still believe this is an ASUS overlay software issue and not a GPU or Windows issue. I may soon do a complete wipe of the OS and install a fresh copy of windows and not the ASUS version soon, the problem is that the ASUS overlay has features that are not built into windows or the GPU drivers.

Update Jun 2 - System was sent back to ASUS warranty on May 10. No communications from the company except when I check the status on the website, it says that it was fixed and sent back. Still waiting for the system to be returned.

Update fall 2021 - sent laptop in for a 2nd service, this time they replaced the motherboard, hasn’t locked up since. Frustrating that is took hours on tech calls and having to send it in twice, should have been fixed the first time

B0865RZR9S,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,26 November 2022,the United States,False,"So I want to start by saying I am not a techy person. I also wouldn't really consider myself to be much of a gamer either so there was probably more research I should have done prior to making this purchase. As someone on the impulsive side I saw a review for this laptop by someone who also plays Sims and when my basic AF HP ran out of storage a week in to playing I knew a change was inevitable so I added to cart without hesitation. I should have hesitated. Shiny object syndrome had be wowed right out the gate as it's truly stunning visually. That's pretty much where my love ends. This computer runs SOOOOOO loudly when playing even with very little mods or CC in my game. Like it's literally as loud as my 2011 Macbook pro when I have 14 tabs open. I'm willing to admit I haven't read anything in the manual so maybe that's a setting I need to adjust but I hate it. My HP didn't even run that loud and the specs on it aren't even half as great (as far as I can tell haha). The game play is moderately faster and noticeably smoother for sure so there's that, BUT I don't want to feel like I'm in a wind turbine plant 5 minutes into playing. There are also some minor functionality things I don't like overall when using the computer for day to day things but I don't quite know how to articulate those and I also don't know if it's user error because I haven't configured anything to work in my best interest. How it came out the box is how I'm using it and it's a different user experience than I'm used to and change is hard for me. Overall, due to my own lack of interest in learning how to use it properly for the moment I'm giving this laptop a 3. This is the most I've ever spent on tech and that also played a huge part in my rating. I expected a lot but don't feel like I got it. I do understand that this is more of a ""starter"" gamer laptop so maybe that's why it performs how it does but I think I could've been better off with a less basic version of the HP I already have.

B0865RZR9S,Anonyme,2.0,Sans titre,15 April 2021,Canada,False,"Le seul et petit défaut que j'ai pu trouver à ce portable jusqu'à maintenant, je vous le donne tout de suite: la sensibilité du pavé tactile pour le clic doit être rehaussée d'un cran dans les paramètres ( ceux du système d'exploitation ) et ce n'est pas à cause du pavé lui-même mais bien à cause de la mauvaise gestion par Windows 1020H2 de cette interface matérielle.

L'écran, en plus de ne présenter absolument aucun bleed au test d'écran noir, offre une qualité d'image étonnamment bonne - contrairement à ce qu'on peut lire dans certaines évaluations. Le démarrage se fait en dix secondes, la batterie permet 10 heures de navigation Web, les touches rétroéclairées sont belles et par défaut c'est exactement ce que je voulais comme cycles de couleurs. Pas de programmes indésirables ou presque, juste un antivirus connu mais bon, y'a qu'à désinstaller. De plus Armoury Crate vient seul et non pas avec plusieurs autres composants logiciels; bravo Asus pour ça!

Pour ceux qui ne sont pas habitués au portables de jeux, sachez que la performance n'est pas la même sur batterie que sur secteur. Ce portable est déjà bien assez rapide sur pile mais si vous le branchez pour le tester à fond ( attention à cocher la case Ne charger qu'à 80% ), vous n'en reviendrez pas de sa vitesse! il égale mon gros ordi principal valant 5 000.00 $. Hem! à propos, ne touchez pas au paramètre de réglage du pavé tactile dans Armoury Crate car ça le désactive et vous devrez connecter une souris pour le réactiver.

Le disque système est un peu petit pour mes besoins car étant DJ j'ai besoin de plus d'espace de stockage mais je lui ajoute un disque secondaire d'un To cette fin de semaine et le tour est joué. Ce qui complète le tour du propriétaire, comme on dit. J'ai beaucoup cherché avant de me décider pour mon nouveau portable et tout bien considéré, je ne vois pas ce qu'on pourrait trouver de mieux à ce prix.

Mise à jour très importante:

Ce portable refuse de s'éteindre toutes les deux ou trois fois qu'on s'en sert. J'ai pensé au début que c'était dû à MyAsus qui devait être mis à jour, puis le BIOS... Non! ça se produit dans toutes sortes de conditions, problème électrique à coup sur, je suis tombé sur un citron. J'ajoute qu'on m'avait fait parvenir un produit réemballé, j'avais accepté de le garder au vu de l'apparence parfaite et du peu d'usure du disque M.2... J'ai fait une grave erreur et je suis très déçu d'Amazon ( J'en avais d'ailleurs parlé via le chat avec une de leurs représentante )! À l'avenir je vais y penser à deux fois avant de commander ici!

ASUS agents can't, or won't, tell you where to buy replacement hardware for your laptop; in fact, even if you are someone with over 20 years of experience repairing computers, ASUS will not send you a simple replacement for your SSD. No, you must send your laptop to them for repair. How long are you to be without your laptop? They don't know. One agent told me to take my laptop to Best Buy as they are an authorized service center for ASUS, I said, ""Great, they do warranty work?"" the agent said, ""No, you will have to pay for the repairs yourself."" Well of what worth is their warranty? I'm going to have to pay for a new SSD out of my pocket even though its still under warranty. That bites.
I had another ROG STRIX that had a motherboard go bad and it was just out of warranty by a week. I contacted ASUS because I couldn't find that motherboard anywhere. ASUS said they don't carry part like that because the ROG STRIX is built to different specs...what? You don't carry replacement parts for computers your make and you can't tell me where I can find one? I ended up sending it to New York and a shop there was able to fix the motherboard.
So, laptops = excellent I own three; ASUS and their warranty/service department = SUCK I won't buy another ASUS brand computer ever again.",0

However after a couple of hours reading ASUS's documentation for the laptop on the MyASUS web site, it turns out that I can build everything if I ever need to reinstall. It won't be a factory image, but it will work fine. What ASUS REALLY REALLY needs to do for this and all of their systems is to collect all the relevant online how to's and documentation in a single pdf for download. Printed instructions don't need batteries. The other thing they need to do is to create a restoration media .iso file that can be downloaded by a customer so they can make a factory restoration media USB drive or a DVD.

B0863Y4QGV,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,28 October 2020,the United States,False,"What do I like about this laptop?

-Value for money: you won't find a laptop that looks and feels this good for the price with the specs.

Build quality: immaculate. It's not metal, but it's damn tight nonetheless. No screen or keyboard flex, and it feels as solid as a brick-- not overly heavy, just solidly built.

Screen quality: amazing. The 240hz display really shines, and the colors are very accurate and vivid. Some other laptops in this price range only cover about 60% of the srgb color gamut, but this one is very close to, if not 100%. For a gamer or someone not doing precise art or visual editing, this is fantastic. Response time is great at 3ms.

The included asus software is intuitive for the most part, but I do still have to mess around with it a little bit to master some of the more advanced settings.

Thermals: the thermals are typically in a very good range, even under load. I don't own a desk, so I have it resting on my bed when gaming-- that's typically bad for cooling. However, I've kept an eye on the temps, and it hasn't yet gone into a range where I felt it was in danger of throttling. The computer itself stays cool to the touch too, with the exception of the heat vents.

Fan noise: even at full speed, they're not annoying. They don't have the higher pitch that some other laptops have (ex: acer helios 300). And when you put them on silent mode? They're inaudible.

The keyboard will take some getting used to, I think? But it's still good. The arrow keys are shrunk a little, and I often hit the caps lock key instead of the a key. Also-- can't find the number lock key to turn the trackpad into a touch numberpad? Not a big issue, but very confusing.

The lights: very flashy! They aren't as reactive as I'd like when put into music mode, but I'm sure I'll live lol.

All in all, there's a few minor things that I'm not crazy about, but I still love that laptop. 9.5/10 from me!

B0863S8HJ3,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,27 December 2020,the United States,False,"This is my first time buying a laptop with a large purpose of it being able to run high graphically demanding games well. It's daunting to analyze the various gaming pc's and laptops with their various specs because my gaming experience before hand largely came from just buying the next Playstation. I didn't really have to analyze the specs beforehand, I just knew that I wanted the next console, but with buying this gaming laptop I found myself enjoying my purchase greatly. The games I've played so far look amazing, the visuals look smooth when playing and what made transitioning a little easier was an application that was previously installed that automatically adjusted the game graphics to it's most optimal settings with the laptop's hardware. I'm enjoying this gaming laptop greatly and see myself being a fan of gaming on pc.

Some things to take into account, from my research, it seems that the laptop heating up while playing high graphically demanding games seems to be a common thing and that is the case with this laptop as well. I highly recommend buying a laptop fan as well. It can also get noisy on depending what game you play, but it's not as loud as when my ps4 on it's loudest days.

The only thing I would look for in a new gaming laptop, taking my experience with this gaming laptop, I would look for higher quality GPU and maybe CPU. The only reason being is because in the application I mentioned earlier that set the graphic settings automatically, I noticed for the games Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Borderlands 3 had an optimal graphic setting that was in the middle of the bar that represents the graphical quality that was being achieved. While games like Apex Legends optimal settings were automatically set to the max value. I'm new to analyzing computer specs for the purpose of gaming purposes so I'm not completely sure at this moment in time if my analysis is correct for getting a higher graphical quality, but what I can tell you for certain is that I'm enjoying what it's displaying despite it not being at max settings; it still looks glorious.

Also has no camera native to the laptop. I didn't really care about this but I thought it apparent to mention because I previously thought that this was a common thing among laptops. After gaining more knowledge, I realized the case that the camera is not available is because of a lack of space for it because it's a pretty big screen and the whole thing feels pretty compact.

It's also very fast on loading things up and doing general stuff. For example, it loads all the start up applications and is ready to go almost as soon as I turn it on. I believe the cause of me seeing this large change is because it has an SSD and my previous laptop had an HDD. I hope this was helpful and informative, I'm new to analyzing computer specs and weighing their pros and cons so I would double check stuff I say in this review relative to when the discussion is relating towards computer specifications.

This laptop has been nothing short of amazing for me. The reviews about fan noise are extremely overstated. If you are running a AAA game on it of course the fans are going to spin up and make a little noise.

Also, the review that says the keyboard and track pad locked up on them I highly suspect they accidentally disabled them in armory crate.

I’m not going to waste time restating what others have said and keep this simple.

The build quality is superb. The laptop feels sturdy and the screen has minimal flex when opening with one finger from the center or either corner.

The I/o is sufficient and exactly what you would want from a gaming laptop. 3 USB ports, a USB-C port, HDMI out, a full Ethernet Jack (not one that pops out), and a combined headphone/mic jack.

As far as the specs go, I’ve included a screenshot of a benchmark list for common laptop CPU’s as of today 2/25/21. The Ryzen 7 4800HS is a monster. The 1660ti max-q is the equivalent of having a 1070 and both of those GPUs are more than enough to run today’s AAA games at 1080p with reasonable graphics settings. Not to mention the screen with 144hz refresh looks PHENOMENAL.

One final small thing worth mentioning is the bloatware included with this system is minimal and that’s great in my opinion. Just uninstall mcafee and you are good to go if that type stuff bothers you.

Overall, if you are looking for a laptop in the 1k-1100 range stop looking and buy this one. It’s worth your money.

B0862269YP,Neil A. Chambers,1.0,Useless if you want to actually do anything,31 July 2022,the United Kingdom,False,"This is the worst device I've ever bought.

I have an old laptop I use for photo editing, music etc and a HP Chromebook for general use.

Unfortunately, (the hidden secret in all chromebooks) the update support has expired on my HP and I am finding it harder and harder to use it as more apps and sites won't accept the old settings.

So, I decided to pick up a new chromebook (after checking when the updates would end - 2025 seemed far enough away!) and saw this Lenovo. I use a lenovo laptop (not a chromebook) for work and thought it would be a good choice.

Huge mistake.

This chromebook is useless. It constantly fails to load pages - informing me there is no internet, while also showing a strong connection in the corner of the screen. Some pages never load, others take several minutes and multiple 'reload' clicks.

It has also started randomly blocking pages as unsafe (amazon at one point!) - I have checked every setting and there is absolutely no reason for this.

It can't even use google sheets properly, constantly freezing and informing me I have no internet while still loading other pages. Even selecting work offline doesn't seem to work as it still keeps freezing.

In all, this is the most frustrating device - I will be replacing this at the earliest opportunity and would recommend anyone looking for any kind of laptop/chromebook to keep looking.

Avoid!

B085G9JGTX,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,24 January 2021,the United States,False,"I needed to replace my beloved Zenbook that Ii had bought back in 2015 and got me through my last few semesters of college and started my journey into getting a job at a law firm. I LOVED that little computer, so when it finally quit on me I knew I had to get another ASUS (I had Dells prior to that, and they were the bane of my existence). I ended up purchasing a Vivobook 15.6"" from amazon that had a ryzen processer in it instead of intel, and let me tell you that was the BIGGEST mistake I've EVER made. it was such a SLOW thing, the screen was like something from the late 90's AND would turn GREEN when I was watching videos, and it didn't have a backlit keyboard like the page had advertised. While it looked nice, it was basically just a huge paperweight for what Ii needed it for. I was so upset because I was out nearly $900 and nearly lost all faith in ASUS, but I continued searching for a new computer.

After some serious research between different computers, and REFUSING to have ANYTHING to do with a ryzen processer EVER again, I hesitantly came to this computer and after reading all the reviews on here for it, I decided to give ASUS another shot.
So far, I am SO glad I did.

While I wish I could have afforded the 1tb version of this, I'm glad I got this little computer. It's BEAUTIFUL, light and fast, and it has everything that it's supposed to. It's not PERFECT; the screen is glossy and shows EVERY spec of dust that attaches itself to the screen, and I wish that the backlit keyboard had the function of cutting off after a while of not using it like my previous Zenbook did, but they're little annoyances that I can deal with. As you can see from the pictures, I ended up fixing the glossy screen by putting a matte screen protector on it. It's not perfect, but it does the job and I'm satisfied with it. All in all, this is a wonderful little machine that so far has everything that I wanted from my last disaster. I ended up giving the Vivobook too my mother as she doesn't really care about the specs as long as she has a computer that runs and can do the occasional word processing and such that she can't do on her iPad.

I would definitely recommend that you get this little machine. It's not the latest tech, but if you're looking for something fast and light and looks GOOD but won't cost you a fortune, get this little guy.

B085G9JGTX,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,31 March 2021,Canada,False,"After getting an expensive gaming laptop with bugs and fans that were unbearable, I was looking for a laptop that could handle some casual gaming and schoolwork with a discrete graphics card. This laptop checked all the boxes and is a great machine for the price, it handles the games I play very well and despite some minor complaints, I like it a lot.

Pros:
- Fast and good with gaming, gets a little warm but nothing horrible
- Fans are pretty quiet, even with gaming they're not too loud, and I haven't experienced any blasting fan issues like others have
- The charger is nice, I think the length is good and much longer than my old laptop's charger. It's small and not heavy, so it's easy to bring with you (which will be necessary as the battery is not great)
- I loved that it came with a sleeve! The mouse is pretty nice too, but I've always wanted a laptop sleeve and it makes me feel better when transporting the laptop around
- Super thin and light, feels really solid, and the colour of the laptop is really nice

Cons:
- Battery life isn't great. Lasts about 5-6 hours with normal use for me, much less if Bluetooth is connected. But I'm usually plugged in so it's not a big deal, and I think this is to be expected if you have a discrete graphics card in a laptop
- I've had some minor screen flickering issues but they seem to come and go, and I think I have adjusted settings to fix this issue
- Bluetooth has some issues where it cuts out sometimes (especially when using the mic), but Bluetooth is an imperfect technology by itself and this could just be a driver issue
- As others have said the keyboard backlighting really sucks. This doesn't bother me much personally, and when it's dark it doesn't look as bad, but I'm going to be getting a keyboard cover because it's not exactly pretty

If you're looking for a cheaper and light laptop with gaming capabilities, this will serve your needs well.

It's cost effective, with 8GB Ram, 500 GB SSD, Intel I7, this baby runs as smooth as butter. Start up takes approximately 1 second, if not less. Program launching is swift, video and audio play are clean, though I must say the speaker could be a little louder but besides that I have no complaints.

The battery life seems to hold as I usually only ended up charging it once a day with consistent use (i.e. at least 12hrs). It rarely overheats and if it does it is not for long and the fans are not super loud. One thing that does annoying me is the charging indicator, I wish the light would change to another colour after reaching 100% so I don't have to keep checking myself.

The Zenbook is great for software development as all my programs run smoothly. All in all, I am completely in love with this laptop and I hope it stays that way.I would love to give feedback on game play but I am not an avid gamer.

*****KEYBOARD*****

I do miss the numeric keypad but I'll be honest and say it is not a major concern for me and it something I seem to be doing just fine without. They keyboard works well though the compactness of it is something that is quite a culture shock and takes some getting used to after coming from a 15.6"" laptop. However, if you have small hands then you will be just fine. The ergo lift is something I completely enjoy which enhances my typing experience.

- Muy buena cámara web y audio poco bajo que decente pero cumple su función
- Puedes comprar muchas de las apps de la android store

DESVENTAJAS:
- No tiene teclado latinoamericano, así que no puedes escribir la letra ""Ñ"" y la distribucion del teclado es diferente a la de Windows así que a ciertas personas mayores de edad supongo les causara mucho conflicto.
- Tiene tecla BLOQ MAYUS, pero tiene el símbolo de la lupa, así que tienes que configurar que esa tecla sea BLOQ MAYUS y no de BUSCAR, es muy fácil de hacerlo y no es ningún problema.

Es una MUY buena compra en relación de ""calidad"" solamente, así que va a durar bastante tiempo sin tener que comprar otra , PERO en cuestión de USABILIDAD creo que el teclado es bastante malo para cierto perfil de usuarios.

Creo es la mejor compra que puedes hacer si quieres gastar poco, dure MUCHO, sea muy rápida y NO vas a usar programas de de windows que sólo se pueden instalar en windows como cosas muy profesionales como renderizados, etc. Sólo ten en cuenta que debes de adaptarte al nueso sistema operativo de Chrome OS y el teclado que no es latinoamericano, aunque puedes comprar un teclado externo y lo lee bien.

B0852BTGGH,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,25 August 2021,the United States,False,"I bought this Vivobook model S533F in Sept. 2020 and have been very satisfied with it. I have had Dell and Toshiba laptops before this. I wanted to try a solid state model and am always surprised at how fast it starts up. It is thin and lightweight. I like the brief keyboard lights, and the moving keys feel just right. I never used a fingerprint logon before, but now that is all I use, it's great. I love the screen - it's a good size, and it is made of etched glass so you don't get all the reflections, which always bothered me. I can't understand why manufacturers went back to the shiny glass screens. I keep a micro SD card in the slot. Windows has been updating fine with no problems, and it looks like the Vivobook will take Win11 when it comes. Windows 10 comes with a nice little email program and I use it all the time. I can see all four of my mail adddresses without having to switch email programs.

Cons:
Has no CD/DVD drive - I really missed it and bought an outboard drive for around $20.
Why no numlock light? (Caps Lock has a light!)
Wish I could add more memory. I have a couple of apps that really push the memory and sometimes even crash.
Camera is only so-so. It's not usually a problem, but with COVID have been Zooming a lot.

Laptop fell about 3 feet onto the living room rug when it was plugged in. It landed on the power jack and bent it badly, so I had to buy a whole new power block for $20. This is not a mfg. fault, though. I just got the power block; it came very quickly, so thank you Amazon.

But for these I would give this machine 4.5 stars if I could, but it's a keeper.

Backlit keyboard is awesome when using it in low light. Very lightweight with clear and vibrant graphics. The M.2 NVMe is upgradable to a larger one, but sadly no slot for a second M.2 drive. RAM is motherboard bound, so no upgrades there either. For the price, you get good form, function, and value, but not much in the way of upgradability.

B0846LZ75G,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,2 September 2021,the United States,False,"1. This PC came with a 1 yesr warranty already counting down from month's before. I don't give a darn about what the seller (DIG JUNGLE) responded about contacting Lenovo to ""restart"" the warranty. (I used Lenovo's contact form for this purpose and they never responded). I should not be the one having to deal with this headache for a product advertised as ""new"".

2. I knew I would need to upgrade to 16GB of DDR4 memory to replace the 8GB the computer is sold with. Fair enough. What I did not know nor expect is that even with 16GB on board, this computer is as slow as a snail just for starting up and simple browsing. A technical lab analysis shows that chances are the cause is the 1TB SATA HDD the computer comes with. I'll be replacing it with an SSD in the hopes of getting normal performance out of it.

UPDATE
------
3. The lab which our business has been working with for 30 years discovered that the SATA HDD was faulty. It should never have passed inspection, neither by the manufacturer nor by Lenovo. Something is very wrong here!

Summary: Just don't buy this notebook. Why Lenovo would disgrace their reputation with such a useless PC is beyond me. LET THE BUYER BEWARE!!!

B082DVWBRM,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,8 September 2023,the United States,False,This is a pretty good little laptop when things are functioning correctly. I knew when I was buying it that it was a renewed and not new unit and expected a few hiccups but had a few major issues. Firstly the battery had not been tested and was at 10% health and needed to be replaced. The second and more serious issue was OS failures and thermal runaway caused by physical errors on the SSD. The SSD had three large burnout spots on the bottom of the card when removed. Undoubtedly the resulting OS crash issues are why the original owner sold it back to Amazon in the first place. However better QC should have addressed these issues before it was put up for sale again. Good news is neither of these problems is insurmountable and both are fairly cheap to fix. The battery and new SSD ran me about 150$ all together and the repairs require a bare minimum of tools/talent to carry out.

That being said, a few reason for not giving four stars:
> When I started it up, I thought it was bricked. It sat at the spinning wheel of death forever. I almost returned it, but I found instructions to fix (remove all previous user profiles and user install software using advanced options at start up). I think this one was rejected by someone else, even though the seller claimed it was new.
> The fan comes on during moderate use. It's not as loud as other laptops I've had, but it ain't silent
> The screen is glossy rather than matt. I saw this in other reviews, didn't think it would be a big deal, but it's definitely noticeable.
> I rated battery as four stars but I don't really have enough information to make a good judgement; I don't usually stay unplugged for that long.
All that said, it's still a great laptop and I love how light it is for as big as it is. The bulkiness prevents it from being comfortable on my lap for long, but I mainly use it as a desktop replacement that I can if desired unplug and take anywhere in the house. Overall, I'm glad I got it. Though I wished I'd bought it at Costco for $160 less before the price went up.

The battery suddenly wouldn't charge and because the system routes power through the battery in a series circuit rather than having the battery in a parallel circuit I can't even use the device while plugged into the wall. It requires the battery to be functional even when plugged in.

The system recognized that it was plugged in. Windows said ""plugged in, charging"" so the power adaptor was working. (I even tried a different power adapter from another ASUS notebook with the same specs. Same result. And power adapter from this one had no problems charging another ASUS computer. So the plug works fine.) But the battery wouldn't charge. When the battery finally drained to 0% the system powered down and it dead. Can't be charged. Can't be powered on.

Can't even use it as a desk top while plugged in.

From reading other reviews this is a common problem.

They did not recommend replacing it.

I paid $800 for this laptop and can’t say it was worth it. It always had issues starting up in that I would put it to sleep and try to wake it up, but the screen wouldn’t come up so I had to force it to restart. I made sure to completely shut it down regularly and keep up with its antivirus and file cleanup.

Two stars because it got me through school. If I’m spending this kind of money, I won’t look for the bare minimum anymore. Thanks but no thanks, Asus!",0

I looked and compared things for weeks on end. This was the best laptop that I could have ever bought for myself. It runs great, I find no problems in it being slow. The Touch screen works great. I love that I can fold it in have and use it as a tablet if I want. Sometimes when I'm laying in bed to watch a movie I can flip the screen backwards to stand it up. The sound is also amazing on this thing! I am able to have a lot of tabs open at once for school and I have had absolutely no troubles with anything so far. The camera quality is also fantastic for those of you stuck in zoom classes. The battery also last me through at least one, if not two full days of usage. It's really nice that the charger for the computer is a US-C cable, it works perfectly with my pixel phone! If i ever need to charge anything I just switch back and forth between my computer and my phone.
Although quick thing, if there are any gamers stumbling on this computer. Although, it is a very amazing computer but I seriously doubt you can run anything heavy duty on here such as a Call of Duty game, CSGO, or anything that needs a lot of ram. If you love playing minecraft though, I was able to run that very easily without no problem.
Overall it is a great computer, if anything ever happens to this one I will for sure buy from this company again. Also extra brownie points for this company because it came in A WEEK EARLIER THAN IT WAS SUPPOSED TOO!! I was shocked to find it in the mail. Any college student looking for a nice computer for school, don't worry no more because this is your best option!

1 Year After Purchase -
This computer is still working wonderfully! I got a small crack on the screen but I'm having someone replace it soon. It sucks though cause once the crack happened I lost almost all of my touch screen so hopefully the new screen will fix it! The fingerprint sensor is a little sassy, sometimes she wants to work and sometimes I have to put in my pin number instead. Besides that, I still absolutely love this computer and would recommend it to anyone. It's very portable especially through travel, which I do frequently in my large campus. The charger still works wonderfully, so does the keyboard. I love everything this computer has to offer. Now on my second year of college as a Sophomore, I still haven't seen it run any slower than it did when I first got it. I LOVE THIS COMPUTER! The sellers were a little annoying to work with, but they still responded very quickly when I had an issue come up with my screen. Overall still a 5/5!!! If you are looking for a computer, this has been my LIFESAVER.

In the past I have had Surface Pro's, Acer's, Chromebooks, and Dell's. While each one of those has something special about them, this one is above and beyond. It is sleek, smooth and stylish. The hinge is tight, yet not loose. The sound bar is great and is in a perfect position as it's not on the bottom, front, or side of the laptop like most.

B0811ZZMP9,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,13 September 2021,Canada,False,"I've had this laptop for 4 months now, so I think I'm in a good position to make a good review on it. So here we go :

Pros :
-The weight to performance ratio is pretty amazing. In other words, this laptop is very small and compact, yet it's performance is very great considering! I need high performance, I'm in the programming field, so I was used to 15 pound laptops that were super big. This one is so tiny, one time coming back from work I took my laptop bag out of my car and thought I had forgotten my laptop at work for how light it was! Thankfully I hadn't.
-As I said , the performance is great. I do a lot of programming, and sometimes play video games on this laptop, I don't think you can expect to run some really really demanding stuff on it, but I haven't had any problem with it so far.
-The laptop has a really nice texture, really nice feel to the keys and is overall very fun to use.
-There's a touch screen with a pencil you can use to browse. I personally don't use this often, only when laying in bed without a mouse, but if that's something you like, the feature works really well.
-The battery life is pretty good. Nothing amazing, with the description of the product it gets a bit overhyped, but it's pretty good. If your laptop is fully charged, you can probably expect to use it for 2 straight days without charging it IF you're not doing anything too crazy, like just writing word documents and such. If you need high performance stuff, we're talking about maybe 6-8 hours, sometimes less.

Now here are the cons
Cons :
-There seems to be a lot of faulty products, which is a shame. Mine had some issues. For instance, after the first month of me getting it, it started crashing at random moments. Sometimes it wouldn't do it for a day, sometimes it would do it every 5 minutes, pretty scary considering sometimes I had important work on it. I tried to contact the seller about it, and they never answered, which was kinda worrying. Fortunately, it stopped doing it after a few weeks and it's been fine in that department. If you buy it, make sure to keep a close tab for the dates of return.
-There's only one usb port. Kinda frustrating since this is a high performance laptop, you'd think it would have at least 2, one for a bluetooth mouse, one for a usb key, but nope, gotta buy a hub for multiple usb stuff on it.
-Maybe this is another faulty problem with my laptop, but I get random performance crashes for periods of a minute to five minutes. Pretty frustrating, since I often have business meetings where that performance crash will disconnect me from a meeting and I have to apologize. Definitely the biggest problem with my laptop, and no , my internet is not the problem.
-The price is a bit high. 1600$ considering the potential issues is a lot to ask. I had the chance to buy it ""used"", where a person ordered it, returned it without using it, and they sold it to me for 1200$. Definitely a good deal at that price, but 1600$? Seems a couple hundred too high considering the issued.

All in all, a decent laptop, but if you don't get this at a discount, I would look at the other options that are available before making a choice.

This machine hits a sweet spot in terms of power and overall usability. Don't listen to any of the negatives, this thing has a very bright and crisp screen, awesome keyboard, and is a great size overall. Despite reviews I've seen, the fan noise is barely even detectable, and comes on so infrequently anyway. The sound is as good as everyone says it is. The battery is decent for this powerhouse with the 1080 screen; it will easily go all day. Slip it into a sleeve and it lives in my bag, take to meetings, seminars, on airplanes. I am so glad I never went with the competing Dell or HP. This is by far the best laptop I've ever owned!

8 months later and I am so glad I made this purchase. With the pandemic we are all online at meetings all the time, and this machine is my go-to. I don't ever need headphones because the audio tech is such that the speakers don't interfere with the microphone...there is no feedback or echo. Even the face to face meetings (wearing N95), this machine is the sweetest one on the table in terms of sleekness and style, and size. Also, while I have a port adapter, I don't carry it around and use it more as a docking station. So as one of the only machines with classic USB ports, I can tell you that it will be used.

I saw it displayed at electronics store and it really seemed to stand out from all the other laptops and ultrabooks there. I took some time researching, mulling it over, comparing it with a lot of others. I almost went with the Lenovo Flex 5 but decided against it in favor of the durable metal case of C940.

What got me started on insisting on a 2-in-1 in the first place was me contemplating getting the Samsung Tab S7+ tablet (12""0), which competes for the Apple iPad pro. But by the time you get the tablet and the keyboard case that goes with it, you are shelling out nearly $1,000 just for the baseline model. I love Samsung and Android.... but this is not the most versatile experience. Even Microsoft Office is stripped down. Then I thought, ""Why not go with a device that morph from a laptop into a big tablet like the S7+ or the iPad Pro? Plus, I get all the benefit of Windows apps, I can run Android apps (though Windows Your Phone app or even better through Samsung Dex)"" That way I'm not spending money on 2 products, but 1....

So began a big search and comparison in the realm of 2-in-1 ultrabooks.

As I said, the first one that caught my eye a the electronics store ended up being the one after long decision I bought, the Yoga C940. And I couldn't be an happier. It's lightwight, durable, SUPER FAST (the highest performing SSD and RAM is installed), has a beautiful screen and good battery life. My use is everything except gaming. It's a classy machine all around. Quick observations:

* It's very fast. Nothing runs slow on this machine. The specs on the SSD are 3 Gig read AND write speeds, Along with Intel Optane, 12 gig of DDR4 SDRAM and there are no bottlenecks. Apps open rapidly and the machine is smooth all the way around. With the lid closed (sleep) when reopening it is instantly on, just like a smartphone. Tap your finger on the fingerprint reader and you are instantly in.

* Screen quality is excellent. I got the 1080 HHD one, rather than the 4K, primarily because I didn't want the extra battery drain with the higher resolution panel. Before I got it I was a little concerned that it would be mediocre. FAR from it.... crisp graphics, nice color range, dark blacks. My eyes are accustomed to my Samsung Galaxy S10+ Super AMOLED phone. There is no let-down when glancing back to the Yoga. I run the screen at about 75% brightness. if i was younger I could get away with less.

* Battery Life - I would say 8-9 hours with regular usage, web browsing, writing, media play. I have the Intelligent Cooling turned on and there is absolutely no slow down that I can see. Scale of 1 to 10, I'd give the battery 8.5

* Ergonomics - the keyboard is generously sized and I find it mostly easy to type. It's very, very slight stiff in keypresses, but nothing I can't get used to. I chalk this up more to sturdier quality.

* Sound - BEAUTIFUL! I love classical music and it's perfect for that. I love how flipping around to tent or tablet mode does not compromise the sound at all. Hats off, Lenovo, the sound bar design is BRILLIANT. Good, clear well balanced sound for such a small package.

* Other modes - very nice. The tent option is nice for media play without exposing the keyboard to food or whatever. I use it in tent mode when preparing and eating dinner. Tablet mode is very nice. Just a nice alternative to sit and enjoy reading, browsing or media consumption.

* Onboard pen - what a nice extra feature! And I love how it is neatly stored and charged in the inboard ""garage"".

Overall... this ultrabook hits it out of the park!
I highly recommend the Lenovo Yoga C940 for you if you are looking at a compact (without sacrificing screen or keyboard), very durable, fast and versatile ultrabook get it!

B0811ZSCLQ,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,28 March 2020,the United States,False,"Long story short: I needed a gaming laptop that could keep me mobile, play the few games I wanted, and keep up on personal tasks that required a graphics card. I didn't want to stay cooped up in the office on my desktop. I bought this laptop for two reasons;
1] Spend a relatively small amount of money, since this wouldn't be the main computer for gaming or any projects.
2] I wanted nvidia/intel pairing due to AMD just genuinely being super loud and much hotter, despite a lower TDP.

So.. VALUE wise? 5 stars. The OVERALL value of this laptop for an everyday ""This is my only machine"" laptop? 4 stars.

Things to point out:
-The screen is in fact 60hz, like the seller says in the Q/A. The FX505 series can come with panels UP TO 144hz and POTENTIALLY IPS instead of LED. This one came with 60hz.
-The RGB control for the keyboard needs to be downloaded on the app store, ""TUF Aura Core"".
-I cannot mess with the processor and undervolting it to make sure it draws less power and gets a little quiet, but overall still happy regardless of this.

Pros:
-Great color on the monitor/panel.
-Typing feels fantastic. Responsive.
-The entire laptop looks sleeker and less bulky than usual gaming laptops.
-Plenty of USB ports in case you want to adapt to a USB C or if you want a hub.
-Stays COOL. Average medium settings on most games drove the temps on my CPU to 60 celcius. (Having nvidia/intel instead of any AMD components help with this.)
-In addition to staying cooler than most, the cooling system exhausts the air through the BACK of the laptop, instead of the side or in the hinges towards your screen. This means when typing or resting your wrists on here, there's no hot spots. This is a quality of life change.

Cons, most isolated to my laptop I bought:
-Overall build is plastic feeling and a little low quality. It flexes too much in areas like the top panel, the hinges, base of the laptop.
-The 'M' key is a little sticky, or there's something under the keycap in the membrane. Unsure yet. You can't disassemble these keyboards without breaking it 99% of the time, so if I have to I can just replace it.
-The hinges are very wobbly. Be very, very careful opening up your laptops in general, but especially on this. Barely poking this with my index finger when the lid is open and the screen wobbles, yet when I type it stays put and doesn't wobble. So that's nice, at least.
-It's a bit loud when plugged in for cooling its graphics card and CPU, so if you want a silent build this may not be for you. It's definitely not super loud, I've heard worse, but it's going to be very hard to ignore. Putting in ear phones and listening to some kind of noise passively will help drain this out.

I'm genuinely happy with this build. This isn't my main work station, it's for when I need to be portable, on the road, out of the office and still play my games or work on projects. It's super cheap compared to what you can get in this price range, and when I say that I mean with intel/nvidia vs amd. I'm telling you, spend the extra $150 and make sure your processor isn't a ryzen CPU. A friend got one of these series of laptops with an AMD processor and similar GPU, and the thing seems a little more loud when gaming and is *definitely* hotter by 10+ degrees Celcius. Not good :(

This laptop is amazing. It only takes couple of seconds to bootup and has lightining fast response.
Along with this laptop, i also ordered 8gb of ddr4 2666mhz ram and a screwdriver kit with a plastic wedge thingy to open this laptop up. I am planning of getting another 2.5"" ssd to add into it, as 500gb in 2019-20 is not enough.
Laptop display is very good and most of the games that i tested on it was in very high or ultra settings, at which i got 60-50fps avg.
Its build quality is superb and it doesnot flex (unless you literally use unrealistic force at which point any laptop will either flex or break).

Overall, i will definitely recommend this laptop.",0
B0811ZSCLQ,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,31 December 2019,the United States,False,"After having used this piece of equipment for a week, I've concluded that this is a very cheaply-built, yet medium-high performing laptop. The key deck is plastic and flexes about .003"" - .004"" in the center under my keystroke pressure. I feel-out how much pressure is necessary to depress the keys. I typically apply this principle across the board in order to prevent undo wear and extend the life of my belongings. The keys are mushy but tactile enough to get the feel of how far they have to travel before registering. The keys are quieter than the ones on my Mid 2010 Apple MacBook Pro. The keyboard backlight is good. ASUS's TUF Aura Core app is required if you want to change the color and settings. There are only 3 brightness levels apart from ""OFF."" The brushed plastic finish is relatively easy to keep clean, but it's flimsy cheap as well. The machine performs well, but I'm mostly utilizing the i5-9300H processor and 8 GB of DDR4 RAM this has since I don't do intense gaming. It will accept up to 32 GB DDR4 2666 (PC4 21300) RAM. If gaming is what you're looking for, I would look up comparisons between 4 GB and 6 GB graphics cards. At this point, I think 6GB would be worth the difference. Use the function key and hit F5 to toggle between ""silent, performance, and turbo."" This corresponds to processors clock speed. Silent is about 1.8 GHz, performance is standard clock speed of 2.8 (?), And turbo around 4.0. Note that this has no internal optical drive, so you'll need to purchase a separate one if you want to run CDs/DVDs. The matte display is nice. I've had a glossy one for years. I think that the color reproduction is more realistic than most monitors I've seen.

Overall, I like it. I'll be babying it, but I think it will serve me well for a long time.

Wanted something that is durable and able to support medium-intensity gaming plus any other day-to-day abuse that kids could throw at it, and also has the graphics firepower to enable me to dabble in video editing. Since this is functioning as a de-facto desktop, the size, weight and battery life compromises did not bother me; in fact, I like the fact that I can limit the length of gaming sessions simply by hiding the power cord. The customisable RGB keyboard is a fun touch, and it will be fun to change the keyboard colour to suit the tastes of different foster kids. The screen quality is great, really enjoy the clarity. I also love that there is room to upgrade the RAM and storage -- as an aspiring sewing blogger I still don't know if I will focus more on text or video, so having the option to increase RAM and add a hard drive later, while incurring lower upfront costs now, is perfect to allow me to phase in functionality depending on how my content evolves.",0

B0811ZJ3H9,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,29 January 2022,the United States,False,"I've had this Lenovo Chromebook for about a month now, so I feel that I can give an honest review about it. I'll start out with the good. The screen on this Chomebook is really nice! It is bright, colors are nice and it is a touchscreen that works good enough for me.

Another thing I like: the backlit keyboard. I often use this Chromebook in dimly lit or dark areas and having backlit keyboard is a nice feature I've never had on a Chromebook before. The downside of nice screen and a backlit keyboard is that the battery life suffers. The battery life not too good. I replaced an old HP Chrombook with this one and the battery life on that was about twice as long as this Lenovo.

Now on to the processor and speed. Keep in mind, I am NOT a gamer and do not play games on my chromebook. The worst thing about this Chromebook is the processor. In a word, it is SLOW! I have used AMD processors in PCs before and haven't had any issues with performance. But this processor is just flat out bad! For example, I am watching a YouTube video and want to expand to full screen. I press the button...it takes a second to think about it and then when it does go to full screen, it is really jumpy while doing it. To me this is really dissapointing. I wanted to return it, but didn't want to deal with the hastle. It works, just not the type of perfomance I expected from AMD and/or Lenovo.

In closing, if you are looking for a Chromebook with a backlit keyboard and a nice screen, and you don't care about performance, than this will work for you. But for me, the terrible processor and battery life just ruin this product. So I can NOT recommend it.

B07Z11X58J,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,24 May 2020,the United States,False,"(07/26/2023) UPDATE 3 years later: I have put this computer through actual hell and it works like when I first bought it. BOY does time fly. I’m updating it to 5 stars because it really did hold up its end of the bargain. This computer has seen my best and worst days- and hasn’t flinched. I use it damn near daily and have had my fair share of spills, overheating, 24+ consecutive uptime- this thing is a TANK and worth every last dollar. I hope everyone else who’s bought it, especially if they used my review for assurance, has the same experience I’ve had. This was NOT a cheap computer and I LOVE it. Looking back at how critical my review was, all the things I nitpicked it for didn’t even matter in the end. Like- it *really* didn’t. The computer has only been matched with modded videogames. That’s it. If you aren’t using this computer for heavy gaming it literally does everything. I can’t think of anything this computer hasn’t done up until I pushed its limits with some unnecessary gaming tech. I’m not gonna lie to you, I’d buy a desktop version of this PC in the near future. I really do love this laptop and would like to see an equivalent in the future.

ORIGINAL REVIEW :
4/5 stars : Acer Aspire 5 - RYZEN 7
.
This model was probably the highest priced and the most expensive amongst the other 2 ones that were reviewed. I got it trusting the reviews and saw nothing bad was written about it though only 3 reviews were present.
.
Now obviously I’m writing this now, after day 2 of using it, rather then month 6 of wear and tear. So far so good. That response should be expected when trying anything new for a short period of time.
.
.
.
Issue 1: The speakers sometimes don’t sync with my video or sorta “black out” for a second. But it also just so happens that the computer gets really hot when that happens. So I mean, maybe if it stayed cooler the speakers wouldn’t fade for seconds at a time. I also ran it for about a full day, so a reset and some cool down time helped.
.
Issue 2: That being said, have something to cool it with. This computer could legitimately burn you it gets so warm. Not the end of the work though, all of my other computers have done that, I’m pretty sure that’s normal unless you have a high-tech device with a built-in fan. So please be wary of that.
.
Issue 3: The HD camera is 100% HD. I used it for other apps, but what’s seen in my little Zoom camera, the HD is non-exsistent. IDC though because it’s HD where and when it needs to be so :)
.
Issue 4: The SSD available is about 475 instead of the 500-ish. A little disappointed about that, but all I PERSONALLY needed was 256GB, so I can’t complain at all honestly. But anyone who wanted what they paid for? I’d be wary. I literally searched it’s system preferences the “technical” way by using the hidden commands to find those specific details. The computer blatantly states that all 512 is nowhere to be found, but 475 is. And even of that, about 23GB are already being used. Again though, I don’t really care. Peep the photo to see what I mean.
.
Issue 5: The RAM’s actually 5-ish GB, not 8. I think that’s a given with any computer, but I’m no tech expert. So I thought I’d key that in. I didn’t do a thorough check on my last computer, but I think my last one was about 6 or 7 of the 8. They both run pretty equivalent despite the major differences. Not sure if upgrading the RAM will start to show it’s superior quality, or if maybe it’s still being broken in for the first week. Who knows.
.
.
.
Highlight 1: Backlit. I don’t know why no computer seems to like back lit keyboards, but that’s genuinely something I would turn down a perfectly good computer for. I wan’a be able to work in poor lighting conditions. That said though... I can figure out how to keep the back lit on :( It’ll turn off after awhile.
.
Highlight 2: The screen quality is SOOOO nice I was shocked. I must’ve thought they were lying or something when they mentioned the high screen resolution because I was astonished at what I saw.. Absolutely beautiful.
.
Highlight 3: Though it’s not necessarily faster then my original laptop, that might just be my wifi. I thought the 7 would be a drastic improvement in processing speed and whatever else I read the expert’s write, but I can’t tell. Again though, it’s available storage and RAM is not optimal either so maybe that’s change if I upgrade those? Really, really not bad at all though! It runs AutoCad, Rhino, and other heavy, heavy applications with little issue! It’s also excellent at multitasking thus far, minor issues considered. I can’t speak for gaming, but I’d like to imagine that those programs are definitely for higher functioning computers- nothing a mac could handle :)
.
Highlight 4: All its parts and pieces where in order upon receiving it. I’m pretty sure I ordered brand new(I know that’s so bad of me to not remember). If I didn’t for whatever reason, the packaging and computer has like- no sign of use prior. Even it’s battery life, which is usually a very good indicator of used or new, shows no tampering. If you aren’t aware of what that little trick it, try it on your phone! So for Apple for example, you have the battery life- I’m on 82% right now.

Then, inside settings < Battery < Batter Health, you’ll notice that it’s not 100%. Mine’s 90%. Meaning that as I’ve used it, it’s maximum capacity has gone down. Basically stating the battery has had wear to it. As it continues to decrease, the phone may shut down at 3% instead of 0%, or take 10 minutes instead of 5 to recharge from 0%. Things like that.

I’m not entirely sure if I found it in the right place, but I didn’t see anything stating the battery’s life was diminished, so surely its as new as promised!
.
Highlight 5: I saw some reviews on the Ryzen 3 talk about a crappy mic and camera, which scared me for the 7, but so far both are excellent quality. Works really really well. The sound is also excellent. If it doesn’t sound good, either something is faulty- OR it’s on MONO. Mono is a sin IDC and it makes the laptop sound like poor quality looks. Please do yourself a favor and fix that in settings.
.
Highlight 6: Battery life’s pretty cool. I mean, I didn’t formally test it, but I can’t complain from what I’ve seen.
.
.
.
All in all, I’m super excited to see what months are to come. My best laptop was actually a Mac and it ran me for about 4 years, probably longer if I hadn’t passed it down to my mentee. My last one was an HP and it absolutely fell apart when I dropped it accidentally back in early May. That one would’ve lasted me about a year. Some people have Laptops for a few months, others 10 years. I guess I’ll see. Oh, and obviously, for the price I’d like to believe this is pretty darn great so far.

I’d recommend it. Just be sure to 100% check all its features before you start gettin’ all attached- that way issue or bugs can be caught immediately, reported, and replaced. Take photos and videos too between the unboxing to any unexpected errors; cover all your bases :)

B07Z11X58J,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 November 2020,Mexico,False,"Seré muy general, y hablaré sobre los puntos que me interesan y que creo que pueden ser de más utilidad.
Llevo un mes con la laptop, la cual se desempeña bastante bien, si pensamos en el procesador, es muy bueno, a pesar de que es un Ryzen 7 3700u y que en el mercado ya está el 4000, no por eso deja de ser una computadora que te da estabilidad en su uso, una de las desventajas que tiene es que trae por defecto Norton Antivirus, pero se lo puedes quitar y no hay mayor problema, por otro lado la construcción del equipo es bastante buena, es sólida, es de aluminio que en lo particular me parece de muy buen gusto, sólo el marco de la pantalla es plástico.
El micrófono es bueno, no tienen que gritar para que te escuchen.
Cosas que tengo que me gustan:
La calidad del vídeo, la velocidad de la computadora, al prenderla, sólo tarda en cargar unos segundos, para hacer trabajos de renderizado los hace muy rápido, y no se traba.
El teclado a pesar de que no es en español es muy cómodo, y tiene el teclado alfanumérico, para solucionar esa parte del teclado en español pueden activar el teclado virtual, y verificar la posición de las teclas, sólo es cuestión de acostumbrarse. El teclado se siente ligero y sobre todo es cómodo. Me gusta que sea retroalimentado.
Otra cosa que me gusta es el peso, es sumamente ligera. Y en la parte de abajo tiene tres gomas grandes, que ayudan a que se sujete.
La computadora no se calienta si se mantiene en una altura considerable, pueden pasar días, y estar prendida y no le causa ningún problema de temperatura. La pila tiene una duración de hasta 6 horas aproximadamente.
Cosas que no me gustan:
La posición del ventilador está bajo la laptop, no a un lado, sino se mantiene libre se llega a calentar,
El sonido es bastante bajo, pero es claro, no es abrumador, a mi no me molesta ya que utilizo audífonos la mayor parte del tiempo.
La cámara no se ve clara del todo, pero si es funcional.
Opinión general.
Esta computadora Aspire 5, es una computadora que tiene calidad, y que estable, el teclado es muy cómodo y tiene buena velocidad que se las proporcionan tres elementos, el procesador, la memoria y el disco de estado sólido, todo eso hace que esta computadora sea funcional y sobre todo que tenga poder de procesamiento. Ciertamente si la buscan para juegos si tiene la capacidad de reproducirlos y mantenerse con buen desempeño. Le he dejado haciendo múltiples procesos y no se traba, ha permanecido prendida hasta por dos o tres días. Si buscas una computadora que tenga poder y, sobre todo, sea bonita y ligera, esta es la opción. Pero si quieren fuerza bruta, compren una gamer, por el precio de esta laptop, creo que no podrían conseguir un mejor equipo.
Sugerencias:
Si necesitan una cámara de mejor calidad o un teclado en español, se lo pueden comprar, la computadora vale la pena y se va a poder desempeñar de manera adecuada.
Compren un soporte o un ventilador, con eso solucionan el calor en el ventilador.
En vista de que no tiene muchas conexiones para usb, les recomiendo que compren un Hub, eso les evitará muchos dolores de cabeza.
Si la ven a bajo precio no duden en comprarla. Es una computadora estable.

B07YN3XYVM,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,1 January 2020,the United States,False,I bought two of these for my kids. It is exactly what they need for school work and playing games.

B07YN3XYVM,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,6 March 2022,the United States,False,"I've had this laptop for a while now and can say that it has given me everything I was expecting and more.

First the pros...

It's Windows Pro. not Windows S or a Chromebook. I like being able to install ANY program I want without restriction, even older programs I've had for years. When I go to the internet cafe to write I have my VPN of choice active, for example.

With Windows Pro you can go under the hood and tweak the computer's operation so it speeds everything up. That's a big plus for me given that this computer's specs are slow when you have unnesasary processes in the background. (This is not a computer to buy if you're a gamer.)

The Windows Pro version works best if you spend the time tweaking it.

It is designed with durability in mind, which for me trumps whether or not I can run a trendy online game. I once spilled a whole cup of coffee on the keyboard at the the coffee shop. Other folks nearby were surprised when I wiped it off with a rag, dried it and continued to work on it.

Battery life is stupendous. I can easily take this and spend the day at a coffeeshop or library, writing and light internet and it'll last 8 hours without issue. In comparioson the same activity on an older Lenovo would have me searching for a power outlet in just two hours.

I can use older versions of Photoshop or any program that isn't constantly updating or running hot in the background without a problem. It also runs word processing programs just fine. (If you are like me and save older programs that *work* and dump the rest, this computer might be nice to have.)

I use this mainly for writing. I have a desktop that is more capable for this like Youtube and video editing. As a writing computer this Lenovo laptop is great. Especially if you take the time to set it up and tweak the settings.

Cons -

The main issue with this computer (though not for me) is SPACE. It has a very small hardrive so you have to be careful what you install on it or you might run out of space quick. (This isn't a problem for me as O mainly use this for writing and eBook creation using tiny programs like Sigil and Colabri.) Larger programs though, espcially newer versions of Office and Photoshop might give you problems.

Also, I don't like the design of the SD card drive. If you're not careful when putting it in your computer bag you might accidentally hit it. It's the type that 'shoots' out if you're not careful. This was annoying enough that I ended up covering the SD card slot with electric tape.

Also, Slow specs, especially when you haven't tweaked Windows 10's background processes.

Other than that, there's not much to say. It's a nice, sturdy durable laptop for writer's and students with a few design quirks and flaws. But it works for me, and I've had it for a while, having bought it during black Friday it was a steal.

B07YM9KTW4,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,25 February 2020,the United States,False,"Version Purchased:
16GB i7-9750H with GeForce RTX 2060 and 512GB NVMe SSD

Initial thoughts:
Packaging was quite nice and secure. Felt the laptop was very well protected.

Ports:
3x USB 3.1 Gen 1
1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 (USB-C) - Not Thunderbolt 3
1x Headset Port
1x Gigabit Ethernet Port
1x MiniDV Port
1x HDMI 2.0 Port

Graphics:
When you first use the laptop, please be advised that games and such will likely default to the Integrated graphics card. I didn't realize this and when testing it in Modded MC RLCraft with Optifine, Max Quality, and Shaders I was only getting between 50-90FPS. Once I changed Nvidia Control Panel to make the RTX2060 the default processor, it jumped up to almost 240FPS.

Memory:
While I got the 16GB Model I plan on Upgrading to 32GB when Budget allows for it. (Or 64 if/when there is a firmware update, as many MFG's do down the line)

[TURBO]:
Preset hard-button above keyboard that changes to ""Extreme"" Overclocking, according to Predator Sense. Didn't notice a difference in CPU? Maybe it is a GPU boost? Either way, it definitely overclocked the twin built-in fans.

LED Back-lit Keyboard:
While I cannot say for older models, This keyboard is NOT JUST BLUE. In Predator Sense you can change the color of the keyboard in Zones, or apply a lighting effect. As you will see in the video review, I changed mine to purple.

Battery Life:
Still not adequately tested. I am still updating and installing common software that I use for Development, Work, as well as gaming, so I know it will be about a week until the system is balanced enough to get a decent reading on the battery. That, and Windows itself has already done 2 updates.

Productivity:
AutoDesk Revit 2018 Runs like a dream on here! Opened a decent sized project I was working on and was able to do a High-Quality Render of a cut section in about 8 Minutes, sync back to the central model in 45 seconds, and then close the model. Maneuvering in 3D with this laptop is a dream, even compared to my workstation. The High CPU Speed really helps since Revit sadly still relies on single-core high speed CPU threads. I would definitely recommend this laptop for CAD/Revit Productivity.

Webcam Note:
If you are not paying attention, when you first get this machine you will notice that your webcam randomly will turn on... Particularly once you plug in a set of headphones. No... you are not being spied on, this time anyway. This is due to ""Waves MaxxAudio"" ""Waves nX"" using the ""Sweetspot"" feature. It is trying to give you a relative audio experience based on where the computer ""Sees"" you siting , and can simply be turned off.

Keyboard:
I specifically chose this laptop over the 500 Series because of the 10-Key layout. In addition to Electrical Work in Revit, I also do programming and reporting. Having access to a 10-Key is a huge boon to me. Typing in general on this keyboard feels natural and didn't require much transitional learning from my Microsoft Surface Book Gen 1.

Trackpad:
Overall the trackpad is nice, but it is a trackpad. Get a mouse, and turn off touchpad functionality when the mouse is connected and save yourself a lot of heartache.

Fan:
For everyday use, the fan is fine. If you enable Turbo though, be sure to have a good pair of Noise Canceling Headphones and hopefully have a room/office to yourself. It is quite loud and obnoxious.

Additional Notes: I have noticed that there are keyboard protectors for this laptop, and I fully plan on getting it to protect the Chiclet keyboard long term. With the upgradability that this laptop has, I see it lasting many years to come.
Also... For some, I know it is called a laptop... Please don't use this on your lap. The way the airflow is designed you could seriously damage it, or yourself if you do. I have seen temperatures reach 180 degrees on this laptop already. If you want to use it in a portable fashion, get yourself a nice lap mat that encourages airflow. This is more like a mini Desktop Replacement with how powerful it is.

B07YM9KTW4,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,5 January 2020,the United States,False,"Take this review with a grain of salt, because I'm a longtime PC gamer, but this is my first gaming laptop.

My Model: Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-52) 512GB NVMe SSD, RTX 2060, i7-9750H, 16GB RAM

Gaming 4/5
This laptop runs games very well, but there are 2 (related) issues: Heat and Fan Noise. As stated, I'm not a laptop gamer, so I'm not used to my keyboard getting hot, or hearing my fans scream playing DOOM 2016 and Fallout 4. The laptop ran the games perfectly, but I thought I was going to burn a hole in my desk doing it. I've got a large cooling pad with 5 fans in it, but temps still got over 85C in the CPU, and the keyboard got very warm. Even with the fans turned to Max and Cool Boost enabled, it still ran hot. I'm not sure how much heat is too much, so I'm not going to use this for long gaming sessions of newer games. Temps got over 90 in Red Dead Redemption 2, but that game seems terribly optimized, so I can't hold that against it.

Web Browsing 5/5
The CPU handles multiple tabs and programs flawlessly, and the WiFi card is much better than any other device I own. Videos look good on the IPS display, and the speakers are surprisingly good (I've been disappointed by speakers on friends' laptops).

The Rest 3/5
As mentioned, the device gets hot under heavy loads, and that causes the fans to get loud. Much of the body of the device seems to be made out of aluminum, which feels nice to the touch and adds durability, but conducts heat like no one's business. The battery life only lasts a few hours unless you go into power-saver mode, and the camera/microphone are worse than my phone. The trackpad is good, but I don't really like it's off-center position.

Overall 4/5
I bought this as a way to take my computer with me, and thanks to cloud services I can do just that. I can play my games on the go when required (cloud saves through Steam), and keep up with things online at work (perks of being a maintenance man with your own office). However, I wouldn't recommend this as your primary game machine, as it simply runs too hot and loud. I feel like I'm actively shortening it's lifespan by playing Red Dead Redemption 2, and that's a terrible feeling on a ~$1700 laptop. Using for short bursts here and there when you have down time, or when visiting friends, feels just fine though, and that was what I bought this for.

The SSD boots right up very quick load times, the GTX card is very capable for almost all gaming needs. I have been playing COD Warzone and it runs extremely smooth, the fans do get loud and after a while they REALLY start pushing hot air out the side to where you can feel it on your mouse hand if youre close enough, I think this is a good indicator of how well its cooling. The one issue that lots of reviewers mentioned and its very true, is that the battery life is abysmal, I can play COD for about an hour unplugged, even just sitting there on the homescreen it will only last maybe 3 hours. i get it with all these powerful features it does use a lot of power, but if you think youll have enough battery for a 4 hour flight this isnt it. BUT with how incredibly well it runs my games, i can forgive it i still give it 5 stars even with the terrible battery life because this is clearly a gaming laptop and it doesnt pretend to be anything else. The custom LED lighting for the keyboard is pretty slick, you can give it different light profiles for different games. The monitor is really impressive for a laptop, even high movement gaming looks fantastic with no perceptible lag. The wireless card is very fast i get about 85-90% wired speeds even with a few walls between the router.

B07YLJZV2G,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,23 February 2020,the United States,False,"TLDR: Downside is battery life. But it handles AAA games well. It really is targeted toward gamers rather than for everyday word processing and general use. Five stars for gaming (which it is designed for) and 3 stars as a general use computer (which it is not designed for) due to keyboard layout for typing and battery life.

Pros:

Intel Core i7-9750h Processor

NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660Ti Graphics (this is sort of the middle version of the graphics card available for this machine)

Nicely backlit keyboard. Only white though, no fancy RBG colors.

The ports are along the back, so you do not have all the cables in the way of your mouse. But this also makes it harder to plug and unplug things on the go. Since the Display port is on the back, when using this with a projector you have to do a little fiddling.

300 nits brightness (there are versions with 250 nits, so be careful if comparison shopping)

Thinner than many gaming laptops.

Fan is fairly quiet, and the fan does run when gaming or video processing.

Cons:

Battery life is a hard push at the 5 hours listed you cannot be playing games and have the brightness up. In real use got about 2 hours when video processing or gaming (on purpose to test the battery life) and 3-4 hours when doing more general tasks.

Typing on this for long periods is a bit awkward, partially because of the trackpad and partially because the keys are shifted to the left for the numeric keypad.

No SD card reader.

Ok, so, I replace the fans. No problem.

UPDATED REVIEW: I've just had to replace the fans again. I replaced with OEM almost 1 full year ago, and now I'm having to do the second fan replacement in the 2 years of owning this piece of trash. I'd lower my rating for this, but it's already 1 star

Then Lenovo forces a BIOS update that seems to cause intermittent keyboard problems. And then cracks start forming in the cheap plastic just from the act of carrying this laptop to and from work.

Finally, I try to roll back to a restore point in Windows and the whole thing goes down. Uh oh, better get into recovery mode, right? Well, except for Lenovo never fixed the keyboard issues, so now I can't navigate the recovery environment, because the popular forum fixes were all ""start it with the power cord unplugged until you get to a login screen""... But now it won't go there, and it won't recognize keyboard input, and it's stuck in a boot loop with all of my work files locked up and no way for me to get at them.

I know nobody is looking to buy a 2 year old laptop but, if you are: save your money on this aneurysm waiting to happen. This is absolutely unbelievable failure modes in a laptop after only 2 years of ownership, coincidentally only popping up as soon as I was out of warranty, too. Go figure.

B07XPLKZ5P,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,30 April 2020,the United States,False,"I purchased with the intent of completing moderate tasks like Video chatting, Movie watching, and minor audio editing. I also wanted a laptop that was quick to power up and down.

This laptop has met my expectations of everything I ordered it for. It takes seconds to power up and down. The screen quality is excellent for it's size and it has been able to flawlessly perform any video chatting task I have put forth. If I do start pushing the limits, then I know I can upgrade it from 8gig of RAM to 20 very easily.

If I had a complaint, it would be more constructive criticism than anything else. The fan vents are on the bottom making it best used on a flat surface where there will be plenty of airflow. I do not recommend using this on a blanket or any other cloth surface or the computer will begin to heat up very quickly.

Overall, it is a great laptop for the price and will most the needs of most users.",0

B07XPLKZ5P,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,16 August 2020,the United States,False,"UPDATE!!
I've now owned the laptop for some time. The problems outlined below required a full default restore and reinstall of ALL programs. That always was/is a pain. All drivers were updated after the restore operation and before programs were put in place. Plus, research revealed how to turn audio and visual alerts of caps lock and num lock key changes on (See Accessibility options). That really helped make the absence of the lights a non-issue.
After the latest updates, the fingerprint reader is working very well. Occasionally, one must try several times, often with a sliding motion to get it to read; however, it reads every time!
At this point (and NO THANKS to Acer!!), this is the laptop that I wanted when I purchased it! Acer should be proactive in highlighting these items so as to save their customers hassle. Hopefully, this will help others to get the machine doing what is expected...
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

After just less than 3 months of ownership, the camera is inoperative. It shows the green 'on' light for a second (when activated), then fails with the error, 'media capture failed event.' It seems to be hardware, since every recommended software fix fails.
Additionally, after the latest update to Windows 10, it nows fails with the 'BSOD (bluescreen of death)' failure. SFC /scannow (with the prerequisite DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth) and CHKDSK FAIL to fix the error.

Star Addition...the fingerprint reader is running reliably after the last software update!!
Now, if there was only a way to see caps lock status...it would be perfect.

So, this laptop is an astounding value! The screen is bright, battery life is unexpectedly long (follow the battery break in instructions!), and the ergonomics of the device are very nice indeed!
Eval of Speed under stress-this baby flies! The web access is faster than my provider service, and access to my NAS screams! Boot up and recovery from sleep are really fast, computing tasks sing along, and any video playback is flawless.
The SSD is a little small for my needs, but doubling it was easy, using the provided cage and connector (Note that I stayed with another generic SSD so as to preserve the overall speed). So far, the 8 GB of provided RAM have been sufficient. Even complex multi-operations don't get above 62% of available RAM.

The bad? There is no CAPS or NUM LOCK light! This is a minor, but needless shortcoming. The FINGERPRINT READER by Elan--Wow it is BAD! When it works, it is a dream. Problem is, multiple times a day, the driver gets bent and it just stops. One can access Device Manager and uninstall/reinstall. Sometimes, that will fix it. Other times, the driver will stay dead for a couple of days, then restart. Nothing mechanical here, just the driver is notorious for this behavior across several brands. I took off one star for these two issues.
If Acer would fix the reader, I'd up it to 5 with no reservations, since the Caps/Num Lock thing is so minor.
ACER, DO YOU HEAR YOUR CUSTOMERS??

B07XPLHL3K,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,18 March 2020,the United States,False,"I am a software developer who runs Linux Mint and cares a lot about battery life and portability. This machine does not disappoint. I love it! I would definitely recommend buying and installing more RAM, which is an upgrade I performed myself. You won't regret it. If you're an avid gamer, I'd recommend sacrificing battery life, spend $300-400 more and get something with better graphics. For the average person with a $500 budget, this laptop is amazing.

Wow:
- 8 hours of battery life (web browsing and doing day-to-day software development)
- Great performance for the price point! The 10th generation i3 CPU is no joke! Whoa!

Likes:
- Nice, crisp display, especially for the price point
- 1920x1080 display resolution -- a MUST for me. How does anyone live with less? :)
- Backlit keyboard (also a MUST for me)
- Linux Mint 19.3 works out of the box
- Good build quality. The aluminum on the back of the display is a clutch move -- A smart design decision that makes this thing feel more expensive. Well done, Acer!
- Connectivity options are simple and complete
- Lightweight
- Quiet -- except when you're gaming or REALLY taxing the CPU... it gets loud, but not unbearable. Other reviewers say it's too loud, but I can't complain at all.

Meh:
- Needs more RAM -- but this is not a big problem. A simple search on Amazon gets you 8 GB more RAM for under $40. Install is pretty easy; careful with the plastic.
- Intel UHD Graphics 620 chip leaves more to be desired. Not recommended for avid gamers, but passable for everyone else. I play Minecraft, and it runs great at normal settings.
- Trackpad - it's good, but it's not great
- Charging plug seems to be rather vulnerable to damage if you aren't careful. Don't trip over a wire and pull this one out! It fits in there snugly, and pulling it out at an angle would probably be very bad.
- Power / charge LEDs are located on the side out of PC, which I think is silly. Also no numlock / capslock LEDs.
- Keyboard is soft but passable. Hmmm... that brings us to....

Dislikes:
- Keyboard layout - Boo. Most people won't care, but I don't like it. Acer tried to squeeze in a number pad, and it's just awkward and awful. The number pad keys are just too small to be practically useful (sigh). They also omitted little things like a ""Home"" key, ""End"" page, and ""PgUp"" / ""PgDn"", which are technically on the number pad but behave differently on Linux terminals. The up/down arrow keys are also weird and disproportional. I also dislike the power button being a key on the keyboard, but that's just personal preference. All that said, I've seen laptops with worse keyboard layouts, but this keyboard layout just kinda sucks. It's a crying shame. Oh! And one more thing! The F3 key is brightness down. F4 key is brightness up. The icons are confusing because at first glance it appears to be the other way around.

Strong Dislikes:
- None

Overall:
Great value for ~$450! Despite my rant on the poor keyboard layout, I'd buy it again.

Great case design. 11 screws to slip the bottom off. Came off easy. Verifying the main board set up. This is the Icore3 Intel with 4gb ram and 128gb drive. This board has one ram slot. Important when ordering hence no 2 slot ram configurations would make any sense. Crucial has $80 16gb ddr4 which will bring system to 20gb ram. Love the hard drive chassis is in box. This will definitely need an additional hard drive. Easy to do. So when I booted everything was great. Impressive honestly for the price. Really impressed. So I ran the windows update. Everything goes good. The one major issue is the wireless network adapter continues to drop. Rebooted several times. At some points it would stay on a bit, but it dropped again. So I was disappointed, I know the network is solid. This was only 2 things. Bad hardware or outdated driver. After removing network hardware in device I hooked up to either cable. Ran another windows update. This update provided latest driver for intel wireless adapter. That was 2 hours of wasted time. So.

I mostly use this laptop to go online. The picture quality is great in my opinion. HD videos look and sound good. There are only usb c ports and one sd card reader. I don't have any problem charging it and the battery life seems exceptional compared to a previous Dell laptop I had. I've had one major issue beginning the first day I had it completely up and running. The Wi-Fi symbol disappeared and I had to order a usb c to Ethernet adapter in order to get back online to do any real troubleshooting. Once the adapter came I was able to get the Wi-Fi back. A few days later it happened again. That time I went through the Dell app already on the laptop and found an update for one of the drivers that had to do with Wi-Fi. I downloaded that and got the Wi-Fi symbol back. That's the limit of my troubleshooting skills. If I have the issue again I will contact Dell. The contact info for Dell support is pretty front and center in the My Dell app on the start menu. I sure hope I won't need it! Overall this laptop works for me. I'm not tech savvy so I don't understand what about this laptop warrants the hefty price tag. The size? The speedy processing? Maybe someone who needs a laptop to do more than the basics would have more to say about any exceptional capabilities this might have.

It is a little larger and heavier than I expected, but not so much that it is going to be a problem. The picture quality is excellent. As with all Chromebook's the audio quality is good, but the volume is very low. This is compounded by the speakers being on the bottom (do the people who designed this have a different way of holding a laptop where speakers on the bottom is a good listening position?) Downloading any volume boosting extension will solve the volume problem. It has a large keyboard and touch pad, and the touchscreen works well. It charges relatively quickly and the battery seems to last. I have noticed that with 100% battery, when you unplug the charger, there is a noticeable dimming of the screen, which I will have to look into. I've emailed the seller and I am waiting to hear back about the backlit keyboard and warranty. I am withholding 1 star for not having a backlit keyboard 1 for not mentioning it being out of warranty and 1 waiting to see how this is handled. I will update the rating and comments as soon as the dust settles.

Update. I had a response in under 30 minutes. They apologized for the confusion and gave me the options to either return it for a full refund or they would send me $20. I took the $20 which will buy me a keyboard light. Promt, polite and offered a solution acceptable to us both. Great customer service. Changed the rating to 4 stars.
I have a defacto 30 day warranty, in the return window. Lenovo has a 2 year, in home, service in 24 hours warranty I can purchase, that also covers the screen and accidental damage (if I drop it and crack the screen I'm covered) for $122.45 (plus a warranty reinstatement fee if $22).

This Asus is replacing a rather heavy 15 inch Dell after about a year. Having alternated between Dell and HP disappointment over the past 20 years and about five laptops, glad to try Asus for a change. Takes a bit of use to get used to smaller keyboard but very snappy performance with the Ryzen chip and SSD. Pages snap open fully loaded immediately. Like the skinny bezel and maximum screen size. Wouldn't want to work on a laptop this size but for couch browsing, streaming Netflix or Chromecast to tv, etc, this Asus is perfect.

Windows makes it a bit of an ordeal to open an account without Microsoft affiliation these days. All the same, went through the hoops and problems caused by same cell number and same email as other computers, and established a faux account. Then, created a local administrator account and nuked the Microsoft one.

B07W7PWTL5,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,19 December 2019,the United States,False,"I bought this laptop at just a little over $450. My Vaio finally bit the dust, and I was looking for something in the $500 range that could potentially serve as my primary PC as my desktop has also been nearing the end of its life.

This computer has far exceeded my expectations. I'm actually using it as my primary PC now, with all my peripherals plugged in via USB hub.

The hardest I generally push it is playing Classic WoW (on med/high settings) with maybe a Twitch stream or a YouTube video playing in the background, and it's handled that so far very well.

I'm not going to ding the rating due to bloatware, Windows 10, etc. because these are known factors when buying a computer, so I won't fault Asus for that.

The fingerprint reader does the job well, and I really like the form-factor. It's very slim, portable, but I'm not sure this computer will stand up to too much abuse. I suspect part of the reason for the great price is that the laptop is probably a little fragile. I'm also not a huge fan of the location of the power button, so be careful when you need to use the delete button-it's one button to the left of where it normally is. But again, this isn't a huge inconvenience.

From pressing the power button to being fully immersed in Classic Wow, or a video, or surfing the web, takes less than 20s. The SSD in this thing makes a HUGE difference.

Even with 3-5 USBs connected, and using HDMI to connect to my monitor, etc., the temp has stayed very cool. My Vaio would get incredibly hot toward the end of its life, even with a cooling fan underneath, but this ASUS barely gets warm to the touch.

I was able to squeeze nearly 10 years out of my Vaio, so hopefully this one has the same lasting power.

All-in-all, I'm super pleased with this purchase. I'd recommend it to anyone in the $500 range.

Edit: I wanted to check in at the (almost) year mark from when I purchased this just to say that it's running just as well as the day I bought it. I've treated it very well, kept it clean, and it's in great shape. What really impressed me so far has been the graphics-for a mobile device, the Radeon Vega graphics. I never had a major preference toward Radeon/nVidia, so when I bought this laptop, I just wanted something that could do some light gaming and handle any other daily tasks, and I've continued using it as my primary PC and it's still trucking. Easily worth 400-500 still, IMO.

Edit 2: Thanksgiving 2021 and this baby is still going! I hope I'm not testing my luck by updating, but so far, this laptop has stood the test of time. I still use it every day as my primary PC for every day browsing, Youtube/Twitch viewing, and light, low resource gaming (WoW Classics/light LoL, old PC games). I've treated it very well, don't travel with it super frequently, but protect it well when I do) and it's held up very well.

B07W5XJ21H,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,9 July 2020,the United States,False,"I love this laptop a lot and I find it a lot more useful than a 1 screen laptop. I am an artist and I like to use reference to make art. I am a gameDev as well and it is really nice to code while mapping to get the perfect coordinates ect. to where I want objects or events playing. This laptop is really good at playing games too. I only play COD Warzone and it runs so smooth and nice(way better than my xbox one), but this is my first time playing games on a computer, so I have no complete knowledge or experience in this area(note that this laptop is not a gaming laptop, but can be your gaming laptop.) This laptop plays way better than my best friend's gaming desktop. One thing though is I suggest you not to use the pen on the big screen because when drawing it felt as if I was going to damage the screen trying to make it work smoothly. The bottom screen is more solid for using your pen. Yes, this laptop is doable for linear art/drawing. Drawing is better than any other good drawing monitor that is $1k or less. Of course the top drawing monitors are better suited for drawing, but I think this laptop is good enough to make art and animations. 9/10 for art/animations, 10/10 for gameDev, 8/10 for gaming, 10/10 overall. There is one big problem I have though. The bottom screen usually flickers ONLY when I do a reset, but the flicker goes away after about 10 minutes. I literally use both screens for EVERYTHING, so get this laptop if you want something powerful and could be used for everything while having it be portable. Well another big problem is the battery life sucks ass, it only lasts about 2-6 hours. My suggestion is to turn off second screen if you have nowhere to charge the laptop. Last thing, people might be worried about facing the bottom screen and could be annoying, I think it is perfect. I actually watch Youtube a lot more on the bottom screen, sometimes I forget I am not using the top screen at all while watching Youtube on bottom screen lol. This laptop is for everything, but if you want to focus more on gaming then I suggest you just get the Asus Zephyrus Pro Duo. To me the Zephyrus would be useless for me. Zenbook has both screens touch and the bottom screen is perfect angle for art. Zephyrus has only bottom screen touch and it is angled for gaming. I could have bought the Zephyrus but I am not a hardcore gamer.

B07W5XJ21H,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,3 October 2019,the United States,False,"I've had my Asus Zenbook Pro Duo for a little over a week. Having read the reviews here on Amazon, I'd like to point out a few things:

Screenpad + is a matte finish. This was designed to cut down on glares from the overhead lights found in most public and workplaces. So, yes, it will look dim compared to the 4K OLED main screen. Quite frankly, it's not that distracting, especially when compared the purpose of those. I tend to use the main screen (which is larger) for videos, etc. I use the ScreenPad + for my editing tools, which I think was the purpose for this laptop.

I can tell you this: The processor is powerful enough to run major software that tend to use up most of your processing power, and still leave enough to watch live shows or videos and check your email at the same time. The computer is built solidly. The weight and feel of the keys and touch pad (which also doubles as a numeric keypad with the touch of a button) is solid and feels it will last the life of the machine.

I could go on to tell you more about the technical aspects, which, undoubtedly, you've done your homework by now. But for the aesthetic users, the color is gorgeous, especially if you are tired on light grey, dark grey, and black. It's also really cool that you can have different, but relating, background images on each screen. PLUS, you get a pretty decent Nvidia graphics card, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD...All-in-all, I'm a fan! You won't be disappointed if you are well-informed!

B07W5XJ21H,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,4 November 2019,the United States,False,"Overall I’m really satisfied with this machine so far. I’d give it 4.5 stars. Before buying this model I looked at every other brand and configuration of laptop I could think of - Apple, Dell and Alienware, HP and Omen, Razer, Lenovo, Acer, MSI, Gigabyte, Falcon Northwest, and probably one or two others I'm forgetting. I wanted something powerful enough to run Blender, Sketchup and V-Ray, and Adobe Creative Cloud. None of the other laptop makers had the combination of features this one had at this price point. I kept coming back to this model as being a really good value, not even counting the extra screen. It’s got an up-to-the-second processor, plenty of RAM, a reasonable amount of storage space, and a very fast video card. Construction quality seems solid so far. Time will tell on that.

I haven’t really stretched its legs performance-wise yet. I’ve played some with Sketchup and V-Ray, Blender, Photoshop, and Illustrator, but mostly just tinkering so far. I haven’t really pushed it in a production environment. From what I’ve seen, the performance will be there when the time comes.

The more common complaints I read about before buying – size, weight, battery life, and keyboard layout – are unlikely to be problems for me. I won’t be frequently needing to tote this thing from meeting to meeting or through airport terminals. I am rarely working in a place where I can’t plug in. And I’ll adapt to this keyboard configuration just like I do with every other keyboard at every random computer I sit down at through the course of my life. I mostly use an external mouse but when you think about it, if you’re right-handed, having the track pad on the right-hand corner of the keyboard deck is actually kind of intuitive. I’m sure all those things could be deal-breakers for certain users. You’ll just have to think realistically about how you use a portable computer.

Still working the second screen into my normal workflow – figuring out how to best utilize that extra screen real estate on a day-to-day basis. The ability to have so many different windows viewable, albeit somewhat small depending on the configuration, will certainly be very handy.

Yes, the second screen is matte while the main screen is gloss and it’s a bit dimmer than the main screen. But overall my biggest complaint with the second screen is the viewing angle. For easy to see screen functions like media controls or big icons it’s not a problem. And certainly if you’re watching a YouTube video you’re only slightly paying attention to, it’s great. But reading any kind of fine text is challenging without leaning over the screen to look down on it from a bird’s eye view. Those with bad eyesight may really struggle. I do prefer the matte finish over the gloss finish for touch screen functions as finger prints aren’t as big a problem on the matte.

This laptop isn’t cheap but it has the best package of specs in this price point. Believe me, I looked at all the others. If it’s anywhere near your price range and its shortcomings aren’t deal-breakers, I would encourage you to give it serious consideration.

In my spare time I also play around with Unreal Engine 4 and a lot of 4K games, and it's a dream there as well; very good performance.

I love the keyboard. It's not as good a keyboard as my trusty old Samsung RC512, but it's very comfortable and gives me the feedback I'm looking for. I have no problems typing on it all day every day, and have no problems touch typing on it.

My only complaints are about the camera, touchpad, and product label on the bottom. The camera is placed directly below the screen (a so called ""nose cam""). Since my team is remote (and now working from home because of COVID) I am on Zoom all the time, so this placement is awful. It is the most unflattering angle, and any time you are taking notes during a meeting it looks like giant fingers are reaching out to attack the camera like in a bad ""invasion from outer space"" B-sci-fi flick.

The touchpad itself isn't bad, but the left mouse button is both squeaky and feels cheap. The button is supported more toward the center-right than the left, so if you press down on the left mouse button too far to the left of center it squeaks, might not detect a click, and can get partially stuck. Just needed a bit more care in the engineering to making it better. It's not horrible, but it could be better.

Lastly, about a month after I got it I noticed that the product label on the right side of the bottom of the unit (i.e. ""right side"" as in the side of the unit where the numpad is) was starting to peel off at the corner of the label. Since it's a spot where there's a lot of friction from resting on your lap, it would have been great if they had used a more durable label. I've tried adhering it with some strategically placed packaging tape but that, too, is peeling off. For a laptop that costs $1,200 to $1,500 you'd hope that the label would stay intact for at least the first year.

B07VKJTYVT,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,6 November 2019,the United States,False,"Overall I am satisfied. Price was good. Specs were excellent. The build quality is excellent! Little to no flex in the screen, very rigid body. The keyboard is outstanding! Best keyboard on a laptop that I have ever tried. Runs quiet, and has good battery life so far. HOWEVER, one thing I am SUPER disappointed with is the speakers. Its my understanding that these are upgrades from the Gen 6 now having some top mounted speakers in addition to the bottom firing ones. The bottom firing speaker on the right side makes a very distracting buzz. At certain frequencies it sounds like total garbage. Some blame loose shift/enter keys, some say its ""normal for a business laptop."" I'm not expecting MBP quality sound here, but I do expect it not to rattle and sound like a tin can. I want to really really love this laptop, and I intend to keep it, but the poor rattling, tiny, sound of the speaker is REALLY disappointing from a premium laptop. The sound is so poor that I turned off all system sounds because it made me cringe when i heard it.I removed the back case thinking something may have been stuck or wrong. The speaker are screwed in with some kind of vibration dampening rubber grommets isolating them from the case. The speakers are quite loose. I've considered adding a couple very small rubber washers to tighten the fit slightly to maybe cut down on the rattling sound. But haven't done anything yet.

I hate to be such a downer on an otherwise fantastic laptop, but the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. But overall the good things far outweigh the poor things. I'll use headphones if I intending on listening to a lot of audio.

EDIT- The awful rattle continued to drive me crazy! I purchased a set of very small 1/8” rubber orings and placed them between the speaker screws and the speaker housing. It has dramatically decreased the rattle sound. I am very satisfied with this solution. Very pleased with this device now.

So, I've been owning this laptop for almost a year now and my impression has not changed. Solid laptop for work, gaming, and coding. The touchpad has a few glitches here and there with the zoom-in gesture but that doesn't bother me most of the time. Since the purchase, I've upgraded the storage to 2 GBs and RAM to 32 GBs (which is solely for the purpose I use the laptop for). If you just want to use this laptop to play games and do school work (or pretty much 95% of the jobs out there), the stock performance is more than enough.

Overall, I still recommend 10/10. If the laptop gets hot and the fans bother you then I'd recommend you get the KLIM laptop cooler (costs about $30). All problems solved.

I've had this laptop for 4 months now and I gotta say I am very impressed. Yes, fans are loud but this is a thin and light laptop so it doesn't have room to put in additional heat sinks like a thicker, regular laptop. At the end of the day, you can only fight physics so much.

The performance is excellent. I hook this up to a 43'' super-ultrawide monitor for work (and occasionally gaming) and this little laptop handles with no problem. I can play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare at max settings on the 43'' inch monitor and get 70+ FPS most of the time. I think if you use this laptop for gaming, 16 gb of ram should be plenty. For me personally, I use it mostly for work and always run multiple sheets of excels + a heavy financial software, and I had to upgrade to 32 gb ram.

The keyboard can be customized to per-key RGB and you'll have to download software from Asus for it. I personally didn't care much, so no complaint there.

Battery-life: I work on the plane with the laptop all the time and the battery usually lasts about 5 hours. With that said, I don't spend a lot of time watching Youtube or gaming on battery, so I don't know how long the battery would last under those applications.

Would recommend buy 10/10. Only complaint is that Asus should get rid of the ""Republic of Gamers"" logo and the sound (which you can turn off) when booting up. Some people, like me, need a decently powerful laptop for work so gaming laptops are the way to go, but I don't need to have that logo showing up when I start my computer in front of other professionals.....

B07VF88TMR,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,18 January 2020,the United States,False,"Asus has made improvements with every iteration of the Zephyrus, their thin and light gaming laptop. This late 2019 version comes with 16gb Ram, a 15.6"" 240hz monitor (1920 x 1080), 1 TB SSD, and the Nvidia RTX 2070 max Q video card.
There is software which switches between the 2070 video card and the onboard Intel graphics card depending if it is needed (you can adjust this with the nvidia controller). You can control the fan speed, lights on the keyboard, etc. with the included software.
You have the option to easily add another 16 mb Ram (32 mb, dual channel) and another ssd card.
Performance is excellent for gaming and you should be able to easily play most games at high refresh rates. However, maximum performance can only be attained by using the ac power adapter and maximizing the cooling of the laptop (fan noise will be high). Due to the very slim and portable design, cooling and fan noise seems to be the most problematic issue with this laptop. There are 3 fan settings, quiet, performance, and turbo. You won't hear much noise at quiet and performance but turbo is definitely noticeable. The fans are quiet at turbo and will automatically go into turbo mode when gaming. If Asus can improve the fan noise and heating issues, this would be the perfect gaming laptop for most people.
Pros:
Portability, light weight, excellent screen (very bright, clear), Very fast performance for games, good portable desktop replacement
Cons:
Fan noise when gaming, heat
Updated my review to 5 Stars! Highly recommended!

B07VF88TMR,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,29 December 2020,the United States,False,"Not mad, just weirded out. This machine runs like dream and the screen is fantastic. (240 Hz)
However, it's full of designs decision that are just baffling to me.

Firstly, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, there is only ONE single DDR slot. Meaning you can't upgrade the RAM by adding another stick, you need to replace it. This discovery was unfortunate, because I ordered another 16 GB Samsung DDR that I can't do anything with now.

Secondly, if you order the 240 Hz screen, the backplate will look different than on the pictures. I think there are programmable pixels on it but I haven't looked into it properly.

Thirdly, the CPU and GPU are very close together, I know that this, much like the the single RAM slot, is trade off for portability, but they are basically heating each other. Most of the heat actually comes from the CPU so unervolting it is a good idea. Anyway when the CPU heats up, which is almost immediate, it pushes the fans to extreme rpms and they sound like turbofan engines. I am honestly not sure how the magnesium alloy housing affects the heating problem, I know it's for durability but it seems like an overkill to me. Also the bottomplate is still plastic.

Finally, the touchpad sensitivity, both for moving the cursor and clicking, is just simply disappointing. It's entirely usable, but it can't even hold a candle to my 4 year old Lenovo's touchpad which I had abused to death and it still works brilliantly.

I wish this machine was more cleverly designed, but I can't be mad at it because of the friendly price. It runs games very well on med-high settings for a laptop of its size, and it seems to be perfect for people like me, who only play games very casually and do not expect extreme performance and fidelity. I mainly bought it for CFD and FEA scientific simulations, I'll see how it handles them tomorrow, but I guess that's not really a factor for most people. I might need to replace the RAM after all. Let's hope the sounds won't bother my colleagues too much.

B07VCNTRG6,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,22 March 2020,Mexico,False,"Escribo después de casi 4 meses de uso. El modelo que adquirí es el que viene con el i7 9750h, gtx 1650, 8gb ram, nvme m.2 de 500gb; la adquirí principalmente para jugar, la he usado con juegos como call of duty BO2, warzone, forza horizon 4, minecraft, GTA V. todos los puedo jugar en gráficos altos y medios, algunos como black ops 2 y forza en ultra a mas de 60 fps.

Físicamente la laptop se percibe de calidad, con buenos materiales aunque no premium, no estoy seguro si es de una mezcla entre plástico y aluminio o algún tipo de metal, o solo plástico con sensación metálica, no es muy gruesa pero tampoco muy delgada, es ligera y en general se siente bien al tacto.

En cuanto al hardware solo puedo decir que es bastante bueno, pero si es necesario actualizarlo un poco si se quiere sacar mas rendimiento y provecho, yo añadí una ram de 8gb adicional y un hdd de 1tb. El teclado tiene buen tacto y da buena sensación de calidad; el touchpad no se siente de buena calidad y si deja algo a desear, pero como la uso con un mouse no es algo que me afecte; la pantalla es muy buena, tiene una gran nitidez, buena resolución y buena precisión de colores, lo mejor de todo son los 120hz que dan una experiencia muy buena en el juego; el procesador es bastante bueno y funciona bastante bien, la gráfica cumple con lo esperado, no esperen que de un rendimiento que no puede dar, aun así funciona para jugar juegos actuales en calidad media/alta a buenos fps.

En cuanto al ruido si puede llegar a ser algo ruidosa, sobre todo porque es necesario tenerla en modo turbo cuando estas jugando, las temperaturas pueden llegar a ser un problema si no se hace undervolt al procesador, yo utilizo trottlestop y el procesador rara vez supera los 75°, para la gráfica utilizo msi afterburner para modificar algunos parámetros y logro temperaturas máximas de 80° grados, esto en los juegos mas exigentes; no obstante creo que si es necesario hacer un cambio en las pastas térmicas para lograr mejores resultados. En general creo que la temperatura es un punto débil de esta laptop, pero se puede solucionar con esto.

La batería dura de 2 a 6 horas, dependiendo el modo en el que configures la administración de la energía. Para jugar es totalmente necesario tenerla conectada todo el tiempo, de lo contrario la tarjeta de video se ""apaga"".

El sonido de las bocinas esta dentro del promedio de las laptops, no es algo que en lo particular me importe porque uso audífonos.

En resumen:
Pros:
- Precio
- Buena calidad de materiales
- Excelente hardware
- Excelente pantalla
- Opción de agregar 2da unidad de almacenamiento y ram.

Contras:
- Touchpad malo
- Puede llegar a tener problemas con las temperaturas
- Falta de puertos USB (solo tiene 3)
- No cuenta con lector de tarjetas SD

B07V5FPM21,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,26 March 2020,the United States,False,"I wrote a review a while ago. Wanted to update it with my current situation.

This is overall a good laptop for the price. Out of the box, 8 GB of ram isn't enough though.
I went out and bought a dual channel 32gb ram, made things a lot smoother.

Most games can run on medium to high settings with playable FPS.
Mount and Blade 2 runs about 110 FPS on high settings, but during seiges the FPS can drop to about 50 FPS. (Before the dual channel ram seiges were at lows of 14 FPS, but I think that was an early release bug that was fixed in the game)
GTA V runs almost always 60+ FPS om highest settings. No lag issues. (Before dual channel ram it was like 50 FPS on highest settings)
War Thunder lits between 110-140 FPS oh high settings. (90 FPS before dual channel ram)

My point is, get dual channel ram. It helps a lot.

I haven't tested very many tripple A games yet. Gotta buy them first before i try them.

512 GB of memory is a bit low for me. I like to have multiple games downloaded so i can pick from a good selection. But, the solid state drive is fast and does it's job.

Laptop does get hot when gaming for long periods of time. I'd recommend a laptop cooling pad if your gaming for more than an hour. Fan also gets very loud when on Turbo mode, but if you have a headset you don't notice.

RGB is nice. Screen is crisp. Keyboard feels nice. Laptop camera does its job.

I do recommend this laptop, just get dual channel ram and maybe a laptop cooling pad.

I bought this after using an Alienware 17 for several years. The Alienware was super bulky and heavy - built like a tank - and had cooling issues. In fact, the wiring actually melted inside and fried the hard drive, even though I used a cooling pad (which is a common issue with those per reviews).

But THIS laptop I've had now for over 6 months and it runs amazing. I recently upgraded RAM, which I highly recommend if you're going to be gaming - 16 or more. Also love that it has an open 2.5"" SSD slot - adding a 500gb SSD SATA III today in the open slot. 500GB is great if you're only playing one game or lightweight games, but anything hefty will eat up a lot of the space. For example, CoD Cold War needs 250gb, but I play 4-5 games so altogether they're more than the out-of-box SSD can handle for storage. Upgrading RAM + SSD was about 120 after tax and easy to upgrade! Playing WoW, I can run on max graphics even in 40-man BGs with 60FPS.

I'm in charge of ordering equipment and hardware for our employees, leading to the purchase of 6+ of these laptops to date. Among those purchases, 2 of their SSD memory drives have gone bad (which is impressive, since SSD is supposed to be much more reliable internal hardware than HD). While this was well within the return window for a full refund an replacement, it still left some of our expensive company resources without a company-issued laptop for days.

Also, something that I noticed after purchase was that the tamper-evident seal on each laptop is broken with a disclosure inside saying that they modified the hardware for 'improved performance'. If we weren't having issues with the memory, I might appreciate something like this. Given that we've had two major hardware malfunctions with these in the past month makes me feel like this is a product you should simply pass up for something more well-rated and with a better track record.

PROS: Responsive, high build quality, outstanding keyboard, good screen, excellent audio for a small laptop (front and bottom speakers), sturdy, webcam cover is handy (but is also a con - see below), light weight - easy to carry, professional look, good battery life (but not excellent), easy to use, touch screen, pen is built into the side (you won't lose it), HDMI port, has 2 USB ports, USB C charging is fast, backlit keyboard option (Fn + spacebar).

CONS: Glossy screen shows your reflection (depending on lighting), vent is on the right side (near your hand if you're right-handed), very small power switch on the side of the machine, extremely small webcam cover that is hard to see and move, customized ethernet port (forces you to buy Lenovo adaptor - it's not provided), memory cannot be upgraded (soldered in), tablet mode can be awkward with keys face down on surface, dark grey finish looks good but easily shows dust, some bloatware installed, backlighting is not automatic when room light is dim.",0

CPU performance is comparable to a 8th gen i5, GPU way more. Only real downside after using for a few days is that the battery performance is a tad short compared to others in the market today (early 2020).

Few things to note:
1. The included pen is not a Lenovo Active Pen. Taking off the battery cover, it says it's a ""Lenovo Base Pen II"". Couldn't find much details about it, but writes very decently. I've tried the Apple Pencil as well as the Surface Pen, and it feels very similar to a the Surface's. The one thing that is missing is angle detection, so unless you're using it for drawing, i doubt you'll have any complaints.

2. The GPU drivers on Lenovo's website is seriously out of date! If you intend to use it for any form of light gaming, be sure to grab the latest drivers directly from AMD's website. It literally doubled my FPS in Dota 2.

3. The charger provided uses the US prongs. Be sure to have an adapter ready. I have a tiny adapter attached to the charger at all times, no biggie.

B07TWHYTSQ,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,15 August 2019,the United States,False,"**GNU/Linux distribution notes at the end of this review.

A very nice laptop and it feels premium. The material is mostly plastic but I appreciate that for the reduced weight. This is my first Ryzen machine, and I am mainly using it to run a Citrix environment (cloud-based VM). Today will be the first full 8+-hour day using it. The power brick is not excessively huge. About the width and height of a standard post-it note, and 1"" thick. The cable is over 5' (my measuring tape only goes to 60"") closer to 6'. It has a barrel connector so unfortunately, it is not easily replaceable with a USB C cable (next model, pretty please?)

The keyboard is backlit, which is nice for the darker surrounding often found in my home office. Typing is okay, but there is a noticeably shorter key travel than other laptops/Chromebooks I have used. I'm getting used to it, but like with any new keyboard, there will be a small learning curve. I keep missing the home row and using the Caps Lock as the A key for some reason. I'm using it on a small folding table at the moment so that could be the reason.

The screen is nice, it is a 16:9 full HD screen, and for me, I prefer 16:9 to the new standard of 2:3 (more of a square). It is not bright though. Not at all. Even with the curtains open, there are times when I am still trying to get more brightness out of this display. It's not unusable, but forget trying to use it outdoors.

The touch is fine and works. I did not buy this to use as a tablet though but Windows 10 has some processing going on in the background that makes it easy to hit small buttons in applications without being terribly accurate. The pen is interesting to me as it is roughly the size of a real pen [*cough* Samsung*cough*] which makes it easier to draw/write without immediately cramping my hand.

The Dolby Audio on the speakers leaves a lot to be desired. Some tweaking was needed to get the overblown sounds to subside. During the initial setup, it was hard to listen to. Turning Dolby Audio off though somehow reduces the speaker volume by 2/3... Not the actual volume percentage, but the actual sound. Dolby is using some sort of gain control so 20% volume sounds more like 40%.

4k video on YouTube looks great and only dropped 3 frames in a 2:44 video (Borderlands 3 FL4K FTW!) but that could have been from me trying to make it full-screen. I have not tried any games yet, but I did install Diablo 3, and World of Warcraft Classic. If anyone is interested, I will update this when I try them.

With the Vega graphics, there is an automatic 2GB reduction in RAM availability. Couple this with the 8GB model and you are left with 6GB to run Windows 10 and any applications. Budget for the 12 GB model unless you are A) skilled with laptop hardware, and B) don’t care about the warranty. I’ve seen the tear-downs, and there is an open RAM slot. I usually don’t tear open electronics until a year after I own it (unless there is a reason to do so).

The WiFi issue that is detailed on the 8GB model is non-existent for me. I feel like I may be more qualified to test that as Citrix requires a constant network connection and gives an immediate alert if connectivity drops for more than a couple seconds. No issues here, running the latest Windows updates.

Overall I’m happy with this laptop, It is much lighter than my 15” Acer Predator and looks a lot more professional when traveling for work.

EDIT 8/31/2020: I've been experimenting with GNU/Linux/Ubuntu distributions and I have a small list of what is NOT working with no additional modifications/installs. All of the images were flashed via Etcher (with verification) onto a PNY Elite Turbo Attache 4 and ran in live mode (no install).

Tails OS 4.10 - I was not able to connect a Bluetooth mouse (only Bluetooth device I had available) and it did not appear to allow Bluetooth to remain on after moving to another settings screen. The dual mapped function keys worked for brightness and sound.

Debian 10.5.0 (Cinnamon) - I was not able to see any network, or even manually connect to one. The brightness function keys (F11 and F12) display the icon as if it is changing the display brightness, but the actual brightness of the display remains at 100%

Linux Mint 20 (Cinnamon) - Probably the most compatible distribution with this laptop without any additional modifications. My Bluetooth mouse connected without issue (MUCH quicker than on Windows) and the dual mapped FN keys work as expected with the exception of the built-in webcam disable (F8)

A solid piece of hardware that boots quickly with zero bloatware. I just wish I had done a little more research before buying it, and that I did not wait too long and miss the return window.

What are my concerns? The laptop is heavier than I expected. It probably weighs what it should for a 15inch screen laptop, it is just heavier than what I was seeking. The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. Upon further research, I have learned that 5 hours is actually the norm for this size laptop. I was not thinking I would get 10 hours, but I don't game or stream music/video. The keyboard has two issues for me. First, the printing on the silver-backed keys is very hard to see. Second, the number key area is different from any keyboard I have ever used (and still use at work). (side note: I use an external keyboard every chance I get, and bought a silicone keyboard cover for the other times).

Again, it will make a fine laptop for many people. And I would like to mention the customer support experience I had with ASUS. I contacted the office of the CEO of ASUS and inquired as to any options since I missed the Amazon return window. I received a quick and polite reply, though obviously not what I was hoping for - I still have the laptop.

It's fast and boots up in a couple of seconds. It's heavy, so if it is a tablet you are mostly going to use it for, then you should think about getting the 13"" one. Standing it up for using to watch a movie or you tube videos, it's great. The screen quality is really good, and the sound is plenty loud enough for average use. Wi-Fi works very good and seems to have good range. I had to update Windows security and other things as it was pretty far behind, but updates go fast.
The fingerprint reader isn't great to respond but maybe it will get better after resetting and trying again, so be sure to set a pin which is just as easy and fast to log in. I don't generally like track pads, but this one is large and is silky smooth. Bluetooth works great for streaming music to my speakers and stereo system. This is my first 2 in 1 laptop so I was skeptical of the hinges but they seem to be strong and hold the screen into any position I put it in, so only time will tell if they will work good for a long time.

There is an extra slot for a 2.5"" SATA drive, but it has a dummy in the slot when it arrives. It also comes with 1x8GB DDR4 RAM slot populated.

That being said, I added a second 8GB of RAM (which gives at least a 10% performance boost), loaded it up and was good to go. I had a spare 128 GB 2.5"" SSD that I put in as well for additional storage, though I won't need it any time soon. This thing is a lot faster than I expected. No bloatware (other than McAfee). Lenovo Vantage updates your drivers automatically. It has Windows 10 Pro 1903 preinstalled, and Windows 10 updates took care of the rest. I was off and running within 15 minutes with all my software installed. (Of course, I'm a PC tech with a high speed internet connection, so for some it may take longer.)

This is larger than I expected, but I was used to carrying around a 13.3"" laptop. But that is my fault, not Lenovo's. This thing is about as small as a multipurpose 15"" laptop can get. And the screen is fantastic (HD resolution, matte finish, no glare, wide viewing angles).

Keyboard is what you expect from a Thinkpad, of good quality, and not overly mushy or resistant.

With my standard workload, so far I get 7-7.5 hours of battery life. Most of my work is not processor heavy, and consists mostly remotely fixing, or writing up service details while onsite with a client.

B07SH7JDJL,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,18 January 2020,the United States,False,"First off, I probably am not the most qualified to be reviewing this product, because my last laptop was a 3rd gen Thinkpad Yoga 11e that I saved from the graveyard after my sister left it in the rain (It's a long story, GRIN.)

When I first received the product, the first thing I noticed was that the Lenovo factory sticker that ""seals"" the box was still intact, and so was the sticker on the plastic bag that the laptop was in. So to the best of my knowledge, even though this is sold and shipped by a 3rd party seller, it DOES appear to be a NEW genuine part that has NOT been tampered with. (I bring this up because I remember seeing another review where they accused the seller of selling a fraudulent/used product.)

After unboxing, my first thought was ""Dang, this thing is big."" But this is NOT a fault of the product. I was just used to an 11"" notebook, not a 15"" work machine. For its size, this laptop is slim, light, and stylish. My only complaint about the product's appearance is that the 'lid' is a fingerprint magnet, easily getting smudged. The included charger is a Type-C 65w charger, so to those who LOVE USB-C, this is definitely a plus. Personally, I don't like the small connector for a laptop. I definitely prefer the older style Lenovo plug.

After I got the laptop set up, I was surprised at the screen in particular. This thing looks GREAT. It almost looks better than my 29"" ultrawide that my main PC runs on. The software is snappy, and the only bloatware I found was McAfee. PLEASE, Lenovo, stop using this! McAfee is a HORRIBLE antivirus that eats CPU for breakfast, lunch AND dinner. Outside of that, there is no major bloat, so you're getting VERY close to a vanilla Windows experience.

The hardware is a good spec: Ryzen 7 3700u, Vega 10 integrated graphics, 8gb of RAM, 256gb SSD. But let's stop on the RAM for a minute. 2gb of your RAM is dedicated to your graphics. This means that you're limited to 6gb for the OS. Windows will use 3, so you're pretty much out of luck if you use any software that uses a lot of RAM (Chrome, anyone?) Thankfully, there is a second RAM slot available, and it's reasonably easy to access. (Lenovo is also reasonable as far as warranty is concerned) While I'm on the subject, there is also a spare 2.5"" hard drive bay inside the machine, so if you need more storage there's an upgrade path there as well.

The keyboard is nothing to write home about, but I find it comfortable to work with, and I can type very close to full speed with minimal errors. It's tactile, quiet, and spacious; something my old Yoga 11e couldn't provide.

This is getting long, so I'll summarize. This laptop is everything you would expect out of a $600 ThinkPad. It will get anything done that you need it to, as long as you upgrade the RAM. I would recommend.

This laptop is a powerhouse, with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 graphics card and 15.6-inch IPS Type FHD display providing exceptional visual quality.

As a gamer, I appreciate the fast and responsive performance of this laptop. Games run smoothly and seamlessly, and the graphics are stunning. The laptop's powerful processor ensures that there is no lag, even when running multiple applications simultaneously.

The design of the laptop is sleek and stylish, with a solid build quality that makes it durable and long-lasting. The backlit keyboard is comfortable to use and adds a nice touch to the overall design.

What I appreciate most about the Asus ROG Strix G is its versatility. It's not just a gaming laptop, but also a fantastic choice for content creators, programmers, and anyone looking for a high-performance laptop. The laptop's storage and memory are easily upgradable, making it easy to customize the laptop to meet your needs.

Setting up the laptop was easy, and it came with pre-installed software that made the process even simpler. The laptop's battery life is also impressive, lasting for several hours on a single charge, which is great for long gaming sessions or working on the go.

Overall, the Asus ROG Strix G (2019) Gaming Laptop is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a powerful laptop that can handle gaming, content creation, and other demanding tasks with ease.

It gets hot only when you play and that's completely normal in all laptops and it does not overheat. It's just normal hot. The cooling system is very good.

The battery drains very fast if you do things that require more power... like gaming. But in normal uses, it's ok, about 4 hours of use..

But that's not really a problem since you can simply use it while connected to the charger.

Other then that.. I'm happy with the laptop it's definitely great.",0

I didn't need 32gb of ram and wanted a newer model, so I settled for this one. It will get done ANY basic task you need. Browsing the web (with requires butt loads of memory) is simple and easy, you can have 20 tabs opens and still not reach 50% memory usage. I waited a while to write mt review because I wanted to make sure I made a good purchase, which I did. Not only does this thing come loaded with 16gb of memory, you have 2 additional slots you can use. The hard drive is AMAZING! Plenty of storage and best part is its a solid state drive which makes no noise. The only noise you'll hear are from the fans and graphics card while playing a game. While playing video games on this thing is a dream, if you wanted you could run most games on highest quality. Now the battery is the only thing I have a issue with. It will only last you about 3-4 hours tops if your not playing games. You start to play a game and it cuts that time in half. I understand in order to keep the slimness of the device the battery can only be so big. Overall well worth my purchase, and I hope this review helps",0

Though the 1050 may be outdated it still runs games 1080p 45-60fps, the i5 works very well all round, the temperatures are quite high while gaming so I recommend repasting or a cooling pad. It's very easy to upgrade, 2 m.2 slots, 1 2.5 drive slot, and dual ram slots that max at 32gb. The keyboard, though not the best is great to type on and the size and spacing of the keys is perfect. The red design is nice but stands out too much sometimes. The screen is a 1080p 60hz IPS display that isn't too vibrant but still looks nice.

Pros:
Easy to upgrade
Nice to type on
The red does look nice
Gaming is decent

Cons:
Fans get loud
Cpu gets really hot even when undervolted
1050 is outdated
Display isn't the best

I'd say if you looking to download all those games all on the laptop, DO NOT get the 250GB memory unless you want to upgrade/install a 1TB memory (like i did), i went with the 250GB and sadly had to pay $125 to get a 1TB mR card to store more games and apps

Pros: Plays games really well, love the red lit up keyboard, very light weighted, nice 1080p screen, able to use OBS while recording gaming, ok on storage of a 250gb if you dont play much gaming, able to upgrade memory (i went to 1TB, now i have 1,250GB) , good on battery life i play games 2 hours on a full charge/ about 5 hours on YouTube/& 8 hours on just music playing in background, Comes with FREE not full version of video editing software of Powerdirector: good software (i already had sony vegas pro), came with a case, very loud and powerful speakers, nice design of the laptop its self

Cons: if hard core gamer get highest memory, mouse pad too sensitive, the (N) button on keyboard in the way if accidentally pess its menu pops up in middle of what you typing, needs more usb ports (not an extended adapter), no DVD/Cd drive :( ... (had to buy a external one) , webcam built in aint all good but its ok

Virtualization. Runs Oracle's VirtualBox without any trouble - Windows 10 inside of Windows 10 works very well.
Gaming. I'm not running 2020's top-tier games with this laptop, so my experience will vary from a lot of other gamer reviews. Running GTA 5 with high-quality graphics heats this laptop up significantly - but there's no thermal throttling going on that I'm aware of.
Programming. Runs Visual Studio 2019 Community very quickly - I haven't had a chance to compile any bigger projects in it yet - but I imagine this processor will make these compile-times go fairly quickly.

B07RK5M35T,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,2 March 2020,the United States,False,"I've had the ASUS Vidbook with Intel core i3 (many of these reviews seem to have AMD chips as well) for only a week now but I'm very impressed. What I like first.
Pro's:
1. I like the screen. I've seen reviews that say the screen is basically trash. Well the model I have it's great for what I want. I've owned anywhere from 8 to 10 laptops in my life from Dell to Sony and I like the screen on the ASUS. Mainly due to the fact it's not overly saturated bright. Its more of a soft natural light almost like reading a piece of paper vs bright blues that give headaches and eyestrain.
2. I really like the keyboard so far (not sure how it will hold up with time) Key strokes are easy and the back lighting is just right.
3. It's fast for what I'm doing. Load up speed is great, there isn't much if any bloat ware to deal with which i've found on Dell and other computers. I'm mainly surfing the net, streaming videos, creating power point presentations etc...
4. One of the main things I like about this computer is that it is light weight especially at the price, your getting a relatively light weight computer with a fairly standard size keyboard and screen without paying Apple prices.

Cons:
1. It's hard to think of some con's but one is that the computer comes with Microsoft 10S, which is easy to turn off to 10 Home, using instructions to do so.
2. The battery life isn't the greatest considering I'm not gaming. I would say your getting about 6 to 7 hours for simple computing. I'm sure is fine but I figure be nice if it was 8 to 10 hours, but at this price can't have it all.

Overall I would highly recommend this computer for the price, look, and feel. It has everything you would need for school, most business travel and everyday home at a good price.

El procesador está bastante decente (rendimiento similar al de la zenbook que vale 13,000 pesos), tiene teclado con backlight, es muy ligera considerando el tamaño de la pantalla y, para el precio, tiene un sonido bastante decente. No se calienta y no hace NADA de ruido el ventilador (ya había olvidado lo que era eso! mi pobrecita compu anterior ya pujaba todo el tiempo...).

The i7-9750H CPU and RTX 2070 GPU in this computer make it an absolute dream to operate, both for regular computer use and gaming. It has handled AAA PC games with ease and they look gorgeous on the 240Hz display. Though I have to say that a RTX 2070, even on lower settings, will not push games close to the 240Hz limit. Which is fine.

It is a powerhouse of a PC in a relatively small package, and carrying around the laptop in a bag is not a backbreaking process. When you are utilizing this machine for basic web browsing, document editing etc, I recommend using the ""Silent"" mode, as the fans can be quite distracting, though definitely not the loudest fans I have heard on a gaming laptop.

The ""bad"" (Just annoying to me) stuff that i could say about it is that the armoury crate is the most broken app here, it works.....when it wants, controlling RGB light is alright but if you're buying an asus accessorie with Aura Sync, well i just have to say ""good luck with that"" because you''ll end up like me and just leaving the mouse be on its own whithout syncing it because 70% of the time it wont work, and the last ""bad thing"" would be the mouse pad, i mean, i use a mouse so i dont really care, but when im using the machine without a mouse hmmm you from time to time will enable the num pad, but i dont really mind, in 2 days of use i believe i've turn it on by accident like 6 times.
In conclusion if you like asus and if u like gaming well buy this, it looks great, and it performs like a dime.....

PS: the fans are loud but not that loud, if you've been living in silence well it could bother you but if you live in constant noise in your work or house you wont mind like me when youre used to general noise, the fans are like a lego jet or something xD

At first, these seemed great - performed well enough, great screen, graphics, and frame rates. The fans are quite noisy, but I figured it was necessary considering the graphics card.

Within a few days, my spouse began getting the infamous “blue screens of death” and the machine would only boot to the BIOS. He eventually got it running again, but this has been a constant issue. Mine also began experiencing the same problem - I regularly monitor my core temps during multiple activities and while idle, and they are within a good range. Really, all we do is watch Twitch and play World of Warcraft. We don’t even keep the graphics settings on maximum, the machines are kept elevated with good air flow at all times, and we don’t have much installed on them.

Now in May, both machines are unable to boot, indicating there are no bootable devices. We contacted ASUS and they stated we would either need to purchase a recovery drive or send the laptops back for repairs with an unknown completion date.

I don’t know if it’s the RTX 2070 being poorly designed for a laptop or what, but this model has been nothing but a constant headache. I would definitely NOT recommend someone purchase this if they are on the fence.

Thermals:
The fans are appropriately loud for the power that you get. The cooling solution is very good! I'm incredibly impressed by the fact that it doesn't get hot to the touch, just warm! Where you sit your palm stays cold!
My MSI Ge62 Apache Pro 2qf had horrible thermals despite also having two fans. This laptop does have one additional radiator, and the 2070 is more efficient than the 970m though, so that plays into the incredibly good thermal dissipation.

Sturdiness:
It feels premium, that sums it up. You get what you pay for with Asus. A $2k laptop should feel the part, and it really does! The RGB sorta shows it too! If you're a shower, this pretty much presents itself! When you open it up, the textured aluminum deck will impress you. That isn't painted or dipped, it's actually textured to achieve the carbon fiber look! It's the little things that are getting me on this thing, as all the important things are pretty much as close to perfect as something like this could come.

Sound:
For a laptop of this size, sound is top notch! Bass is incredible and It's hard to believe it comes out of such a small body.

Display:
This 240Hz IPS panel is just amazing! It looks higher res than 1080p to me and I'm not sure why. I'm coming from a TN 60Hz panel, so maybe that's it? Anyway, color reproduion is great and results in a beautiful visual presentation. The fluid motion of everything thanks to the 240Hz refresh rate is just eye candy. Personally, I see the difference.

I have also proven that this panel is truely refreshing as 240Hz. TestUFO.com will be able to show you the difference between 60, 120, and 240 Hz. While it doesn't stick out, 240Hz is noticeably better here.

The only negative of this panel is the max display brightness. It's a little bit hard to see in the daylight, but who will be taking their laptop outside in the middle of the day?

Issues:
This only issue I've had are either petty, or not Asus's fault.
- The keystone keychain holder was torn a bit (not important at all for me)
- Updating the KB firmware was a little janky.
- RGB software is also rather janky. It works, but doesn't feel ""complete.""

UPDATE (6/23/2020):
Unfortunately, there is only one USB host controller for all ports. There is no internal host controller for non-user devices. Everything is shared on one chip. A three camera setup for the Oculus CV1 is very difficult to get working. Usually, two cameras will default to USB 2.0 because of bandwidth issues. It's a shame this wasn't taken into account, but overall it's still a good laptop.

B07QQB7552,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,19 February 2020,the United States,False,"I originally bought this computer with the intentions of programming on the go.

Let's get the bad out of the way first. This laptop is not designed, nor advertised for gaming by any stretch. You'll be able to get away with some older games but forget about getting reasonable performance at reasonable graphics levels on anything more modern. We're talking just barely getting 60fps on Spyro: Reignited Trilogy at 720p, lowest graphic preset. But that's impressive for not being a gaming laptop. Just keep your expectations in line.

The good: This thing is blitzing fast in practically every other regard. This is where the SSD and CPU really take center stage. Everything is incredibly responsive and installs are very painless. Overall usage had me forgetting I wasn't on my desktop at times, so I give this a laptop a solid A+ in that regard. Boot times are damn near instant and restarting to finish installing applications happens in under 10 seconds.

Battery life has yet to be tested very well so I can't comment too much on that just yet. I'll update when I get more usage out of the battery but from the get go, it seems pretty standard.

Screen quality is again very standard. It's not winning any beauty contests compared to a decent ISP panel but again, it's not advertising itself as being anything spectacular in that regard. You get what you pay for and with this laptop, you're paying for the SSD/CPU performance which it absolutely nails.

Style: I absolutely love the way this laptop looks. It's clean, sleek, and professional. Nothing over the top but doesn't look or feel cheap. Build quality is very solid. Obviously it's no MacBook in terms of build quality but it's also less than half the price of a MacBook so again, you get what you pay for.

Sidenotes: My first unit had an odd manufacture defect on the screen; A white blotch that was only visible under certain conditions, namely over more muddy colors like off shades of white, dark blues, etc. It was incredibly distracting but I contacted Amazon who stayed on the line with me while we discussed possible solutions with ASUS and ultimately resulted in Amazon sending me a replacement unit in less than two days. The new unit has none of these issues and looks to be exactly what I was looking for in the first place. So good on both ASUS for making a decent laptop and Amazon for honoring the exchange.

B07QQB7552,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 November 2019,Canada,False,"I was looking around for a laptop, including many more expensive options, before I settled with this one.

The laptop is very fast with the NVMe M.2 SSD, with a disk benchmark, I was able to reach 1.6 GB (that is gigabytes, not gigabits) read speeds per second, and 900 MB/s write speeds per second.

I got this on sale, and for under $600, a Ryzen 5 quad core, 8GB DDR4 ram and 256GB SSD, it is excellent value. Not to mention the great feel of the chiclet backlit keyboard.

The performance of the Vega 8 integrated graphics, is better performance than any Intel integrated graphics would be. The fans is a little audible when running HD video or more intensive tasks, although still very quiet.

The battery life is average, although it can be a little bit above average if you set your settings to battery saver. Still, it should last a few hours at the least. Just a quick note, there is 6GB usable RAM rather than 8GB, as 2GB is permanently allocated to the AMD Ryzen Vega 8 GPU. Also, when first turning on the computer, there is noticable backlight bleed on the bottom two corners of the screen, while the screen is on though, the screen has good picture.

The pictures for this laptop does not do it justice, I was pleasantly surprised when I received the laptop - the laptop looks better in person than it is advertised!

All in all, this is the best laptop one can get for the price, hands down. Definitely recommend it for anybody who is looking for a laptop that won’t put a dent in their wallet. Good job Asus.

B07QM4F25N,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,18 August 2019,Canada,False,"I wrote a very thorough review here. I am unbiased and was even an ASUS skeptic going in. My last computer was slow and 10 years old, so that might account for some my satisfaction. I did one review after 2 days, an update after a month, and one more after 3 months. I wrote such an in depth review because I love this laptop so much, I want others to have it. I believe that as of right now it is the best bang for your buck at the $1000h CAD range. I did a month of heavy research before buying. Be aware, I have the FX505DT variant. Ryzen 7 3750 cpu. GTX 1650 gpu. I almost got the ACER Nitro, and I am glad I chose this based on my experience and reviews of both the TUF and Nitro. Anyway, the review...
----
Ok, so I've only had this thing a couple days, but so far it has preformed amazingly. If anything changes in the future I will update this review. I have the version with the GTX 1650 GPU and the Ryzen 7 quad core 3750 CPU. The laptop came with very little bloatware. Any bloatware installed was easily removed via add/remove programs. The drivers came mostly up to date, or very close to being up to date. The only game I have ran on here so far is Civilization VI, but it runs that perfectly smooth on maxed settings. It feels like I am playing on console. I know, it's not the most resource intensive game in 2019, but still, I am impressed with how effortlessly this game runs. The MyASUS app for driver updates is garbage. I'd recommend manual driver upgrades from manufacturer sites, or use trustworthy software if you must.

I am also getting torrent download speeds of up to 10 mbps, while my old computer maxed out at 3 mbps. I am not sure if this is related to the WiFi receiver or something else, but it's nice not having my internet connection bottle necked any more.

Everything else runs really smoothly, and very quickly. I honestly have not had a single issue with performance yet.

Okay, cons... maybe the trackpad. The left and right buttons are not individual buttons, it is all one wide button. It also really picks up smudges. Also, when clicking on the touchpad itself the whole thing sort of clicks down and feels a bit cheap. I like my trackpad to feel solid when I tap on it. It is very large surface area though and is responsive. Honestly, this is a minor issue for me.

Also, the speakers aren't very loud. They sound good though, just quiet. The battery doesn't last super long, but that's ok for me. Also, it only comes with 8 gb of ram, but that is a cheap and easy upgrade.

I still give this laptop an easy 5 stars. I have never been as happy with a computer purchase.
--------
EDIT: Alright, had the laptop a month and I am even more pleased with it than when I started. I purchased an 8 gb RAM upgrade for only 35 dollars, and the performance has gotten even better. CPU usage is lower too as a result. I have gotten used to the trackpad, and I like it actually. It's pretty good. Still the only gripe is the lackluster speakers. ASUS advertises the speakers like their magnificent for some reason, but they aren't. That's fine as I have them hooked up to my Logitechs anyway, I was never planning on listening to music on laptop speakers. I've had no issues, no glitches, no crashes, no freezes, barely any hangups. Once I accidentally forgot to close Forza 4 and started playing Witcher 3. It started stuttering occasionally, but was still playable with both games open, my memory maxed right out. Going from Win 7 to 10 has been nice too. Loved Win 7, and didn't like Win 10 at first, but I gotta say, Win 10 is stable and reliable as hell. Very smooth OS.
-------
EDIT 2: Ok, now it had been three months. I love this laptop. I have run lots of games on it now. Metro: Exodus, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, The Outer Worlds, Apex Legends, Witcher 3, Forza 4, Farcry 5, Farmin Sim 19... With no problems. Assassin's creed is notoriously CPU heavy, and it pushed my Ryzen 7 to the max. The game ran fine with a locked frame rate though on medium or high settings. All in all, smooth frame rates, quick loading, no overheating. I upgraded the RAM to 16gb which was cheap and has reduced CPU strain and allowed for more multitasking capability.

This can run any game out right now. Maybe not on max, but most games at least on high. CPU reaches it's limit usually before the GPU does though, so this PC fairs better with GPU heavier games. Haven't tried VR yet because I have no headset, so I can't speak to that. Also I'm not snobby about framerates, I'm happy with 30 or more. This runs most games on high 50 or 60 fps, some 80ish, some over 100. I don't hit 120 often, but also, I never dip below or rarely close to thirty during game play, and only on the most intensive games. They call it a beginner gaming laptop, but it can run any game I've thrown at it and gave me a great experience every time. If you are very particular about maxing settings, and getting super high FPS, or require 120 fps or more for competitive gaming, or have to have little upcoming graphical tweaks like ray tracing and eyeball reflections, running multiple GPU intensive apps at once, get something with more than 4gb of video ram. Otherwise this will please most gamers, beginner or otherwise. The Ryzen 7 3750h and Nvidia gtx 1650 are a fantastic match, and seem to communicate beautifully.

Another nice thing is the integrated AMD Vega graphics card. I thought it was unnecessary at first. It's weak, but having two cards is nice. I let the AMD Vega handle minor things like desktop display and let the Nvidia handle applications. This should extend their lifespans. It's also nice for dual display to let the VEGA handle one screen, instead of drawing off the GTX which can focus on one display instead.

The SSD that came with is small, 500gb, but is very quick and reliable. I still plan to upgrade my HD space with another SSD, 2.5 inch SATA for around $100-150 as there is an empty slot.

Another gripe, is only having 3 usb ports, none of them USB C, and all on the left side of the laptop. I ended up getting a USB Hub splitter dealie off Amazon that solved both these problems by reaching the other side and giving more slots. Still no USB C...

Power cable is built sturdy. The laptop itself seems sturdy despite it's plastic casing.

Lots of reviews mention trouble changing the keyboard colour. But they addressed that in a recent update to the Armory software. Also, the Windows Store app ""TUF Aura Core"" allows you to tweak the LED colour anyway. Speaking of the keyboard, it's solid! Feels nice, and the LED is cool.

CPU heat... The laptop will get in the 80's occasionally, but only on certain apps, and usually only when loading. During gameplay it seems to cool down, especially with the fans on Turbo mode. In any case, I haven't had any performance issues, warning, or glitches or any other problems associated with heat. These later Ryzens run pretty hot anyway. AMD themselves said these temps are normal and the cpu will shutdown if it's at a dangerous level. The casing itself only gets slightly warm to the touch. I heard other models having heat issues, but this one seems to be fine after 3 months of heavy gaming.

8 months later:
I find the one weakness maybe haha. Video editing... It's definitely manageable on GPU friendly software like Resolve. It doesn't handle Premiere or Corel that well. Video editing software has not caught up with video quality it seems. Came a long way since Movie Maker days... But if you're editing 4k video, or just doing a ton of video editing in general, this laptop might not give you a satisfying experience. I use Resolve though and runs more than smoothly enough for me. Video editing takes a lot these days, but I bet this PC at this price handles it as good as any other PC at this price.

Hope this review helped. Can't say you will have the same experience as me, but this laptop, on my bed, right now Is AMAZING for $1000, and just in general.

B07Q2RB6BY,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,10 February 2020,the United States,False,"I’m not a tech person so bear with me on this review..
I love this laptop! I had done some research on chromebooks after I decided to not spend tons of money on a MacBook. I am a grad student and need a laptop that would be good for word processing (I only use google docs anyways) and watching Hulu and Netflix. This laptop totally met and exceeded all my expectations and I love it.

It’s very light and thin, and fits perfectly in my backpack. I am obsessed with how there are charger ports on either side!!!

I don’t use the ‘flip’ that much, but it is nice sometimes. I kind of forget that it’s an option but I often have to read long PDF articles and turning it into a tablet and using a stylus to highlight is pretty nice. Also, the speakers are on the very bottom which is not the best sound so if I’m really trying to zone out and watch a movie I will flip it so the speakers are up and the keyboard isn’t between me and the screen. it sounds great like that! The speakers are actually decently loud.

The battery life thing on this is amazing. It can last me all 8 hours while I’m at school and usually can charge my phone as well. I’ve had it for about 6 months and have lately started noticing the battery life is maybe not quite as long lasting as it was when I got it, but I’m still really impressed.

Again I’m not a tech person. I chose this laptop because of Wirecutter’s review and because my fiancée said the specs looked good compared to other chromebooks I was considering. For my purposes, it works great. It’s fast loading webpages, fast downloads, never have a problem streaming anything. Performance wise it is excellent.

The only time I get slightly annoyed with it is that sometimes it drops to WiFi signal for no apparent reason. I can’t absolutely guarantee that this is because of the laptop and not my router, but it happens other places as well. It’s not a constant problem but sometimes I’ll be doing something and all the sudden I will have no internet and i will have to click to the network settings and then it suddenly will be reconnecting to the network. It only happens maybe a couple times a week and it didn’t happen at the beginning.

It should be said that with a chromebook there are a few drawbacks. There are sometimes when it’s frustrating to not be able to get the “desktop” version of an app/website, like Spotify. You can either use Spotify web or get the android app for Spotify, and both of these have slightly less functionality than the desktop app that you could install on a windows or PC. That’s just an example but yeah sometimes there are slightly annoying things about running chrome OS but overall I can do everything I need to do and I’m super happy with this purchase. I recommend this laptop to everyone!!!

Cons
Speakers on the bottom, slightly muffle the sound unless you flip it.
Battery life slightly diminished after 6 months of regular use
Sometimes dropped WiFi signal for a couple seconds and needs to reconnect

Pros
Speakers are lOud
Excellent battery life
Touch screen works great
Nice keyboard
Very fast loading webpages, streaming, etc.

B07Q2RB6BY,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,19 September 2019,the United States,False,"I have had this chromebook for three weeks now, and I have used it on a constant daily basis of about 8-10 hours per day. I am impressed by the build quality and usability. I haven't had a chromebook for a long time. I had an original Samsung Chromebook for a couple years, and back then Chrome OS was still edgy enough to not always be able to fill my needs as a student and teacher, but it was enough to get by until I got home to my desktop. Since getting this Asus c434, however, my desktop has been collecting dust. I work two teaching jobs and attend school, so I am constantly on the computer planning lessons, reading, typing documents, doing research, or just streaming Netflix or Hulu at home.

Screen: I love that it is compact and light, but still packs a 14"" touchscreen. I use the multi-position screen either when I'm using it like a tablet, or I'll fold the screen back and use my own bluetooth keyboard and mouse. The hinge is tight and holds the screen in any position very nicely. The colors are good, and movies are clear and crisp. The touch panel works smoothly, and I find myself using my fingers almost as often as my mouse. Also, I often plug in an additional screen while I'm teaching or working, and I haven't had any issues with that at all. It just does everything automatically, and the processor doesn't get bogged down at all.

Keyboard: I read dozens of reviews before purchasing this one, and the top negative comment was about the keyboard backlight making it difficult to see the letters sometimes. This is true, but the easy fix is to simply turn down the backlight when there is a lot of ambient light. Otherwise the typing is smooth. I don't love chiclet keyboards in general, but this one is not bad, even when I've typed a few pages on it.

Battery: I have gone a full ten hours on this thing while just using browser tabs and typing or viewing. However, there are certain apps, like one game I enjoy playing, that drain the battery more. Even if I play that for an hour or two, I can still get 6 or 7 hours of use without a problem. Usually I just charge it once at night and then carry it with me throughout the day without needing a recharge.

OS: Chrome is smooth and fast, and if like me you mostly use web-based applications like Google office, Office 365, Canvas, Blackboard, etc., then this is perfect. I also love that now Chrome can run a lot of Android apps. I run a lot of the same apps that my Google Pixel phone can run, including some games. In addition, it can now run Linux at the same time as Chrome with the simple click of a button in the settings. I installed a couple of Linux apps just to test it out, and it's pretty cool, like GIMP or LibreOffice. My only gripe with the Linux is that I can't copy and paste between the Linux apps and the Chrome/Android apps. The Intel CoreM processor seems to handle everything like a champ, whether it's having open 20 tabs with 2 screens, or playing an intense Android game. Oh, and I haven't had any issues with the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth so far.

Downsides: Overall, this computer fits my needs almost perfectly. Perhaps the only glaring con I will mention is the speakers. They're really not very loud. Even at full blast it can be difficult to hear in a room with a moderate noise level. Luckily I don't need this feature very often.

TL;DR: I highly recommend this Chromebook to power users of Chrome. It's features and build quality are well worth the higher price.

I love this chromebook and it's exactly what I needed! The keyboard backlighting may be the only down side I have to mention but if you're comfortable with typing without looking at the keys, you won't have much trouble.

Battery life and screen are the major selling points. It's hard to describe the impact of having such thin bezels until you boot it up and see for yourself.

Some say it's a bit expensive, but the aluminum body makes this feel like a very high quality laptop. Like anything else, you have to do your research beforehand. If you don't want aluminum, look for another laptop, but for me, this was everything I expected and more.

Don't take my word for it though, look up more reviews online and do more research before deciding. I did, and I'm not dissapointed with my purchase at all.",0

Not up to Lenovo’s usual standards! Where is the proper documentation for using Linux. I bought this because I thought Lenovo had properly tested LINUX on this hardware system.
Have set mouse to disable touch pad when typing, yet it still arbitrarily moves the cursor when typing.
Battery drains too quickly even with all extras turned off and just using a typing program. Chart available on request.
Documentation for Linux on Lenovo is practically non-existent. All references are to WINDOWS 10 or 11, not Linux of any flavor.
There is NO description of how to use the touch pad for the middle button or the virtual buttons at the bottom of the touch pad as described in the setup for Linux. Looks like Linux was an after thought with no testing for it on Lenovo system.
Inconsistent: Set Printer and printed a test page. Next day, no printer found. It’s almost seems that the memory does not transfer to drive. After making several different changes to setting, those same settings need to be made again since they didn’t “Take”.
This was not a “refurbished” unit, yet it acts like everything is only half way working. I have never had so much trouble with a new computer as I have had with this POS. And I have built several from scratch. My Advice, NEVER buy a LENOVO with Linux installed because they do not know how to install and make it work properly. The battery is still an issue as is the build date of 19/07/04, which I interpret as 07/04/2019, purchased in 2024. Or is that 04/07/2019. Either way, this computer should have been designated as built several years ago with NO NEW technology updated.
I would have had better results buying a WINDOWS computer and installing a dual boot system so I could control what was on it, even if I NEVER ran WINDOWS as the OS of the system. I am very, very, VERY disappointed in this COMPANY!
If I had known, I would NEVER have purchased this junk. Can’t even get a clear picture of how bad the battery is. All the numbers keep changing.
Installing Linus from download, The touch pad did not work at all and had to use a USB mouse to continue.
I am now convinced that if I had bought a windows machine from Lenovo, , I could not have installed Linux even as a dual boot system. This hardware is broken and I will be returning it as such.
Will NEVER buy LENOVO again. EVER!
What POS!

Last Update: SENDING IT BACK! It would appear that some of the earlier data the initial reviews were based on issues with the OS and some of the apps used on this hardware. The battery remaining app takes a little while to calculate the proper amount and changed between readings giving false indications of the amount of battery left. It’s still a POS if it does not provide accurate information and may have been because the as delivered OS was not properly installed. After reinstalling Linux 21.3 and while the battery display program still has issues, it does seem to be better since the reinstall.
The Touch pad is still not working properly but I can get around that. The rest of the reinstalled OS does seem to be functioning better and is more suited to the hardware. Perhaps purchase a Windows system and make it a dual boot system rather than a Linux ONLY system since Lenovo does not know how to handle Linux or provide proper documentation for Linux based machines.
Yes, this is long winded but there are more than a few reasons to question the integrity of a company that would prefer you purchase a WINDOWS system, since their documentation is geared more toward Windows and NOT Linux. (It would seem that Linux is more of an after thought than a real product to them. Still evaluating this machine.
I still think the battery is less than stellar and maybe needed exercising being dormant for so long. I should send it back for that reason alone. Not quite as bad as I originally thought it to be. Still bad. The fact that I still have no middle button action on the touch pad, when I have had it on other machines, says a lot to me. What else does not work properly? Found out how to Disable Touch pad while Typing, however, when disabled, there is no way to reposition the cursor without using the direction arrows (and a lot of time and button pushes.)
There is still no way to make the middle button function available on the touch pad, even though Linux has a setting for that. Or if the virtual buttons at the bottom of the touch pad did as described, Perhaps it could be worth the trouble to set it up.
This may be nit-picking, but if you want to write a letter or a novel, these little quirks can become overly annoying very quickly, when you can’t even depend on your input to be what and where you expect it to be. I’m still going to keep looking for remedies for these issues even though by rights I should return this laptop for false advertising! All my other Linux systems work as advertised, and one is way older than this one (And was originally WINDOWS 7.).
I could not find a Linux manual on their web site without references to WINDOWS 10, 11. This is NOT LINUX!
Just tried to find a couple of games that I loaded day before yesterday. No where to be found. If the memory and drive are this inconsistent, this unit may not be worth saving after all. If it can’t retain the data, what good is a 2 TB drive, anyway? I think this unit is completely messed up and should NEVER have been offered for sale as a LINUX machine.
Nope! Tomorrow, I’m reinstalling Linux OEM version of 21.3 and sending it back. I am tired of trying to fix someone elses crap. You want to make something worth using out of the box, I’ll listen. No guarantees I’ll buy into your crap. I will listen then decide. Until then, your system is noting but a POS!
I’m done. TYVM!

B07N6S4SY1,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,24 October 2019,the United States,False,"Wow wow wow. I can't find enough good things to say about this portable powerhouse. I'm a pretty hardcore gamer who also uses a lot of graphics intensive programs like Photoshop and Unreal 4. This laptop... is not for that.

It's for those times away from your high-end programs, where you need 10 chrome tabs open in a coffee shop while you're experimenting with Microsoft Word layouts. It's for when you're out in the woods and want to sort and organize the photos on your camera's SD right then and there. It's for trips where you want to travel light, but still want the world at your finger tips.

OK, OK, enough flowery language. Let's get to the pros / cons:

Pros:
-The keyboard feels great, with a nice balance of being chunky and ""clicky"" while still being compact. Once you get used to its size, it's pretty easy to get close to your fastest typing speeds with minimal errors.
-This thing is really light. Maybe I'm too sued to heavier laptops, but seriously, this thing is effortless to bring around. Throw it in a backpack, tuck it under your shoulder, do whatever. This thing is pretty durable from what I can tell, so all that lightness doesn't come at the cost of having to gingerly secure it in a special compartment. Any ol' laptop bag / pocket will do!
-The battery life is great! Maybe I'm too used to being tethered to outlets by more power-hungry machines, but I was able to get hours of typing and Chromeing out of this thing. The key I've found (as with most machines) is to keep the brightness a bit low when you're not plugged it, it can make a big difference.
-ASUS has always made my favorite laptops and this one is no exception. If you're a fan of ASUS' work, you'll find everything you know and love about and ASUS packed into a tiny package.
-The ports, lordy, the ports! So many ports in such a tiny machine.
-The screen is far brighter and more colorful than I was expecting. My other laptop is a ""state-of-the-art"" ROG Strix II, with a high color accuracy, high refresh-rate display... the issue is they never calibrate said displays and they always end up coming out sickly yellow, requiring hours of manual adjusting. Not this little fighter though! Bright and beautiful right out of the box! Color pureists will notice things can get a bit washed out, but it's certainly preferable to the yellow tint of other machines.
-The price is the best I've seen for the quality of machine you're getting. This thing is durable, sturdy and built for a few specific things it excels at. It's definitely given my productivity a boost and is well worth the investment.
-There was pretty minimal bloatware on the machine, which was great.
-Office 360 for a year is a HUGE plus. Also be sure to upgrade the machine to full Windows 10 (from S), the process is free, fast and jarringly painless.
Cons:
-Even 64 GBs is not a a huge amount of space. This is definitely more of a document and cloud oriented device. If you're hoping to put your entire music library on this thing you're going to need to expand the storage. If storage isn't an issue, than this is probably the book for you!
-Similarly the 4 GBs of RAM can make this little engine chug sometimes. Don't expect it to be happy with running 20 chrome tabs at once,n or for it to instantly load pages the moment you click them. It's certainly fast enough, but as someone who's coming from a 16 GB machine the little differences can be noticeable.
-The touch pad is ... OK. It's not terrible, but (much like all touch pads these days) it loses tracking now and then and lacks any real buttons for the left and right. I never much enjoyed touch pads to begin with so maybe I'm biased.

Closing thoughts: If you like what you've read, read more reviews and honestly take the dive. If you're looking for a durable portable typer, that can do a little bit of everything this is your machine!

More closing thoughts: A story for you, about ASUS laptops...

In winter I got an ROG Strix II, a very powerful and very pricey machine. It was maddening getting the thing to work properly. Getting photoshop to play nice with the dual graphics. Getting the screen to not look yellow. Getting the damn speakers to not crank the bass. Many of these issues are still unresolved and frankly though I love the hardware I'm more than likely going to have to start from square one with that thing.

I was all emotionally prepared to go through the same process with this little trail-blazer. I was ready to troubleshoot and troubleshoot and finally get something that mostly did what I needed. To my absolute delight, this machine seems to be the last bastion of PCs that do everything right, everything the way they're supposed to, right out of the box. I haven't had to troubleshoot a single thing about this beautiful laptop and honestly couldn't be happier. If you're looking for something portable, something durable, something to up your productivity and most of all something easy to work with, this is the laptop for you.

The SSD I received in mine was a Samsung 981 NVMe, and is blazing fast.

The two thunderbolt connections are full 4-lane PCIe.

Highly recommended, unless you need any gaming functionality - the graphics are integrated with the CPU (Intel UHD 620) and while it is capable of running older games, anything new will require running an eGPU, which I haven't tested.

Build quality is great. The keyboard has a good amount of play to it, and combined with the slight angle to the laptop base while open it makes for a pleasant typing experience.

Battery life is around average, but it's about what can be expected for such a slim (and it is SLIM!) laptop like this one.

I haven't had any issues with the trackpad which has been reported by some users, but it's likely due to more recent drivers fixing the issue.

UHD 4K monitor is beautiful and bright, with good contrast. It has touch but I don't use it, so I can't comment on that.

The model I chose came with a small dock that includes a basic USB port, a USB-C 3.1, and an HDMI port. Enough to add a couple of peripherals, but you'll likely want to go with a larger dock if you have more things to connect.

Overall I am 100% happy with my purchase.

No bloatware other than a couple of Asus utilities, but those can be ignored and probably removed if not needed.

B07MRCB6MG,Anonyme,2.0,Sans titre,20 June 2019,the United States,False,"So, I will preface this with saying, I have built computers and have been using Windows since XP. While I'm no computer expert, I have a fair share of knowledge and know my way around the device.

That being said, while this is a beautiful computer and the functionality and design is as promised: sleek, cool, etc., given the issues I've had technically with my device, these extraneous details come across now as merely gimmicky. I purchased the laptop, swapping it out for my gaming laptop, as I now travel for work and needed something lighter and with much better battery life. However, even turning all of the settings down and close all other applications, the longest I've gotten the battery to last while using just Word is just under 4 hours, only an hour longer than my old gaming laptop. Dissapointing certainly, but not a deal-breaker.

About two weeks after purchase, I arrived at work and began using the laptop for extended hours which is where many of my issues began to arise. At no point would I have more than 9 applications running, or 5 windows open (active applications). And yet, after perhaps 2-3 hours, performance would drop drasticaly. CPU usage never exceed 55% and yet the processing speed of the device would make it unusable. The applications I use for my work; Microsoft Office, Edge, Creative Commons; none have particularly heavy drains on the CPU or memory (save the browser of course, but if it can't run a browser then..). Throughout a work day, I may have to power down my computer twice and let it sit for a few minutes to cool down. This comes as odd given the fan which actually keeps the computer relatively cool. This was mildly irritating but I was stubborn so I looked for solutions.

Then, recently about 4 days ago, the CPU seemed to give out entirely. To avoid having to reset my entire pc while abroad, I've had to all but suspend all start-up applications and boot-up and then close all necessary applications. Due to my modifications, the machine runs about similarly to how I described above. However, the start-up process I have to go through (especially when I went out of my way to purchase a computer with a SSD) is just annoying lol. What irks me is that this deterioration comes ""conveniently"" 3 days after my return policy expires. Not really making any accusations here, but sheesh, frustrating.

All of this being said. If you're looking for a cool looking computer and all you do is write, and watch videos for short bursts of time, I guess I can recommend this computer. However, as they advertise it as a 'light' work computer, I must put the emphasis on the 'light' part. It cannot really handle any tasks that need much computing power and can't handle any tasks for extended periods of time. For that reason, as I swamp through the process of warranty redemption, I can't personally recommend this particular machine.

(I acknowledge though that my device may be an exception though).

B07MRCB6MG,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,12 March 2022,the United States,False,"I have been loyal to the Asus brand for over a decade, and I am a bit disappointed that they keyboard of this is no longer flawlessly functioning. Several keys such as the letters P, H, and K do not provide inputs unless you aggressively press down on the keys, making it difficult to quickly type, as I am having to constantly backspace to make corrections. This laptop has rarely been used as intended, which is to be used on the go. Instead, it has spent more time sitting on a tabletop.

I have had this laptop since October 2019, and don't put it through very hard use. It wasn't until January 2022 that the keyboard started having issues. The laptop is now past its warranty period, but I do not want to open it up to check if the keyboard issues are just being caused by dust or dirt. I have other older laptops that are being used in similar operating conditions and their keyboards are still functional.

The product page on Asus' website claims that this laptop ""meets the ultra-demanding MIL-STD 810G military standard for reliability and durability"". This is the root of my frustration, as the keyboard hasn't met this reliability standard, and I haven't even exposed this laptop to harsh environments.

The battery health is at approximately 67%. Using the Windows Powershell command line ""powercfg /batteryreport /output ""C:\battery-report.html"""", I generated the battery health report of this laptop. It is showing a Design Capacity of 50,022 mWh, but its current Full Charge Capacity is 33,586 mWh. Unfortunately, the Cycle Count is not showing a numerical value, so I do not know how many charge cycles that battery has already gone through to degrade the battery down to 67% of its Design Capacity. Since I first used this laptop in October 2019, I used the MyASUS utility to set the Battery Health Charging to ""Maximum lifespan mode"", which meant that charging would be limited to 60% capacity. I used this feature in hopes to reduce the number of charge cycles and to prevent the battery from constantly trickle charging to stay at 100%, knowing that I'd be using this laptop constantly plugged in. I don't know if this rate of degradation is par for the course over the span of 30 months, under the operating conditions I described, but I thought this was worth mentioning.

Other than the keyboard issue and the degraded battery health, the laptop is still functioning properly today. I still keep it plugged in 24/7, as I also use a third-party dock with the laptop to expand its I/O capabilities.

I still continue to purchase Asus products and remain loyal to the brand, but these shortcomings deserve to be mentioned, for consumers that may be looking to purchase this older model ZenBook S.

B07L38H5KG,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,16 December 2021,the United States,False,"Long because this is $1k and I couldn’t find any helpful reviews. Purchased a little over a year ago. Overall, happy, but theres some stuff, here are my majors:

PROS: Can support multiple adobe applications running at the same time with music, open internet tabs, background processes, all that going on w/ no noticeable slow down/glitches. Also doesn’t get burn-your-thighs hot either unless you’re doing a lot and charging, even then other comps get WAY hotter since this has the tilted bottom (which is very subtle but works). Wifi is great, and gets reception everywhere in my building that my old one couldn’t.

Your eyeballs will be saved by the lit keyboard and the screen is incredible. HD like a fancy tv, deep colors, & bright

The size makes it perfect if you need it to move around a lot with you. Since the screen is so big comparatively to the body it doesn’t feel so small, but is light and really handy if you need to move around on the job, and not feel like you’re going to break something/lugging around a big computer. It feels like an ipad with a keyboard

CONS: (what you’re here for) The built-in speakers aren’t great, my iPhone's volume is WAY louder to give you reference, which makes watching something without headphones annoying.

The screen is absolutely beautiful again, but since the frame around it is so thin, that plastic is easy to come off in little bits making the glass edges of the screen exposed. Not super noticeable or very large (yet) but it’s just happened from use, not dropping/damage.

I thought the keypad would be incredible for typing numbers into a spreadsheet right? Sorta- that keypad is on the mousepad, it feels like a magic trick to activate it, but to type a number you can only lightly touch which is verry sensitive. Accidentally press down while doing this is essentially a left click which can mess you up. You do get used to it and get better, but still hard to not press down to a full click by accident or make a mistake when you’re trying to be fast.

the Sims might load a little faster than on your desktop, but you can’t really play any intense “gamer” games on this. It hints at being good for gaming but it’s going to be choppy with fps issues. Microsoft has a gaming mode which i thought would help a little more but i guess it defaults to being on anyway. Helps if absolutely nothing else that needs to be running in background is on.

Battery life isn’t very long when you’re using it much (ex: multiple adobe apps/programs running) but its an ok trade off for how light it is.

B07KVFTVHX,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,30 August 2019,the United States,False,"I originally bought this item for my child's school work. Honestly it was cheap, and the specs seemed pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised when I started to setup the laptop that it was very fast. The screen is a good size and has great contrast and color. The laptop has performed so well with daily productivity work (office, email, web browsing) that I eventually bought 2 more for other family members.

Power Supply - I have owned several Dell laptop over the years and one con would be that the power connector on this laptop is not as large as on their more expensive models (picture). I find that the smaller the plug the quicker and easier it is to break.

Screen Resolution - I can't truly call this a con because I knew full well what the screen resolution was before I bought it. It would be great if the screen resolution went to a full 1080. But for this price and the performance, I am not complaining at all.

Conclusion:
If you’re looking for a cheap yet good performing laptop for everyday use this would fit the bill. I would and have already recommended this product to others.

The only complaint I have at this time is the setup is misleading and almost had me order two sets of Microsoft applications. The first Microsoft support person actually told the poor but intelligent student I purchased this laptop for that we had to order Microsoft Office software a second time. I hardly think this aligns to the mission statement instituted under Satya Nadella: ""empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more"".

When I called Microsoft, I got Jean-Carlos from Nicaragua and explained the student was from Africa and poor. Jean-Carlos was understanding and we installed together a copy of my Office 365 5-user subscription on the student's new laptop. Really, Microsoft, I have been a fan for many years but can't you please get the support more consistent? You have done so many things right, especially since Satya Nadella became CEO. Would you please try to get the support more consistent? Aim for cloning Jean-Carlos, who understand your mission.

It is light to carry around and perfect for browsing and doing some works. It came with Windows S mode that could be switched out to Windows 10 (make sure that you have updated with Microsoft Store to do this). In S mode, you can't install Apps or software outside of the store). Yes, 32GB HD is not a lot of space and you do need to be mindful about storage usage. It is easy to monitor storage usage with the Windows Storage tool. After uninstalling most games and unwanted apps/software, performing updates and installing Office 365, I still have about 10GB free space. With microSD expansion, storing files is really not an issue. Although I have used Chrome browser in the past, I find using Edge to be smoothier and faster than Chrome on this laptop. Keyboard is easy and nice to type. The laptop starts fast and the fully charged battery lasts about 8-9 hours. Overall, I am impressed and could not be happier with this purchase.

B07JWB7QB2,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,19 August 2019,the United States,False,"I will first say that I began looking at chromebooks as a tablet replacement and not as a standard laptop replacement. And to this end i wanted to keep the tablet form factor. I have only used Samsung flagship tablets, and wanted the greater functionality and power they can give over entry level tablets. Recently Samsung and Apple are really the only two putting effort into the tablet market, and one of their main focuses is on adding in laptop type functionality. The way i saw i was if that is what their focus and justification of price i would look at chromebooks as they are a laptop setup, but can still run Android apps.
There aren't really many on the market. The HP Chromebook x2 is the only other option i could find/considered. It would be a little cheaper and has the keyboard included in the price. Overall the Pixel Slate has better hardware.

The Pixel Slate was not well accepted when it came out and there were a lot complaints thrown against it. Most of what I read complaint wise was software related. I have not seen any of those complaints myself thru my use which I believe comes down to two points. First is time, software is improved continuously over time, and so since I didn't buy it when it first came out, software issues have likely been fixed. Second I never considered the underpowered processor models, and Google has even discontinued the lowest two. I picked the slate with the i5 processor, primarily due to internal storage as the slate doesn't have expandable storage.

The only real thing i have against the Pixel slate is price. I say it is a great product and fits my needs very well. It just isn't personally worth the retail sale price. I bought it when it was on sale. I bought it when it was $250 off, and saved more from the deal i got by signing up for and using the Amazon Prime credit card. Additionally i found it best to purchase from Amazon because of the available protection plans. Best Buy has no protection plan offered for the Pixel slate. Google has one you can buy from them but is only 2 years and is a hair more expensive than what i got with my purchase on amazon. My protection plan covers me for 4 years.

Overall, i have no buyers remorse for my purchase, at the price point I paid. The android Apps work really well. You can't at this time side load apk's, but there is only a couple of apps for me that would need that use. It is something that rumors say could come at some point. The greater laptop function/power over standard tablet is great. I have begun working with the Linux apps as well and see greater capabilities from it as well. I am excited to see all the new software features Chrome OS will bring.

B07JWB7QB2,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,22 August 2019,Canada,False,"This tablet actually does reside on my refrigerator for now; Given the the strong magnets built within the device, I can confirm that this device does stay securely on with opening and closing of the refrigerator door. I can't seem to find any cases for the Pixel Slate as of yet that could endure the elements of the outdoors; There seems to be a limited choice when it comes to rugged protection should I want to take this on vacation with me or on the go. I would love to see a Supcase Unicorn Beetle Case developed for this tablet.

I use this mostly as an information hub with regards to making notes, looking up local flyers, controlling smart home lights, weather news, etc.; It's nice having the OpenTable App to browse or make dining reservations quickly. Currently, the Chrome OS build (76) I have right now doesn't have the Google Assistant feature enabled and I cannot control this tablet with voice commands as of yet which is a bit disappointing.

To really leverage the productivity features in this Pixel Slate Tablet, I believe it's best to pair it with a keyboard; I have a Logitech K380 which does have native support for media control and application switching; I love how easy it is to take a screenshot with a screenshot button function as part of the keyboard. The screen is the most stunning feature as it is very close to a 4K resolution on a 12 inch screen; You can use two full chrome browsers side by side and adjust the resolution scaling to your liking.

With a very solid build quality, this handles and feels premium with the sleek metal enclosure; The charger included does support quick charge and does get very warm when charging from 0-100 percent; The device it's self only gets slightly warm on the back near the center where the battery resides. You'll be very impressed with the audio as this does have two stereo front facing speakers which help with the immersion factor when watching movies and video.

With Chrome OS the organization of Apps is much more easier to understand than a full Microsoft Windows OS; I find that there are a few applications here in Chrome OS that highlight advanced features of Google's Ecosystem: Google Translate, Google Duo, Google Maps, and Google Canvas. You really need to take time to really validate which applications will enhance your experience to bring value into perspective. For myself, this Chrome OS feels very familiar to an Android Phone experience; However, not all apps are compatible. Without a keyboard, I truly believe this makes the device a harder sell based on value given what is currently available on the market for tablets alone.

As for Specs, I believe 128GB of storage is plenty for personal photo, videos and movies; This tablet should be enough to handle handle light productivity work, sending emails, web browsing. Given the form factor, it's rare to see a screen with a high resolution where you can work documents side by side. Paired with a keyboard, this device benefits greatly as it can be a serious contender when it comes to productivity; I would say it's a hybrid that blends a well featured media consumption with an impressive touch screen real estate which is a rare find with notebooks in this price category.

Screen Quality - the Screen Quality I would honestly give it a 4.5 out of 5. Due to the fact that you're a 12.5 inch LCD panel and not an AMOLED panel. So your blacks aren't black and your yellows aren't yellow etc. But still gives you a very nice and crisp screen with that amazing molecular display and I did I mention it gets very bright at 337 nits which can also be looked at in sunlight trust me I have tried it. The touch controls are awesome on the screen a lot of bugs have been ironed out theres no lag between touches from or pen support. I mean it's like freakishly smooth it weirds me out sometimes how buttery smooth it is. My tab s4 doesn't even hold a candle to this screen.

Battery life - 5 out 5 imo a battery on tablet/cpu that can last me a whole work day go home and then watch movies and don't have to charge it till late in the night. Gets an A+ from me no apple or Samsung product has been able to last 12 hrs on a single charge.

overall productivity - okay so here's who this is for are you looking to like heavy music and video production. If so then this is not for you go with a different product. But if your into office productivity, school, watching movies, listening to music and playing the stadia then this is for you. Are you just looking for a tablet and that's all then this wouldn't be for you where the Google pixel slate really shines is in its laptop mode with the keyboards from Google and G-type.

B07HRZM2V4,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,15 September 2019,the United States,False,"Overall, this Chromebook does its job. Given the extremely low price, I will not remove any stars from the rating due to my complaints.

It feels solidly built, it charges from USB type C on either side, and the battery lasts plenty long enough. I use mine for Google Sheets/Drive/Gmail. I’ll have a half dozen tabs open with Spotify playing and it keeps up just fine. As a bonus, I can easily switch between my personal and work account by signing in and out. No mixed up passwords or sending an email from the wrong account.

Downsides: Screen. It’s pretty crappy. You get all of the advertised resolution, which I find to be viable, but it’s literally impossible to avoid color shift. From a normal viewing angle, the top and bottom of a white screen will not match. Other downside is the chrome OS. I knew that I would be limited on programs going into this, but unfortunately some apps are stuck in the mobile version. I tried to use a Remote Desktop app to control my office PC. The app only used the center part of my screen as if it was a phone. On top of that, the app letterboxed the ultra wide screen display. I was left with a “desktop” the size of my thumb in the middle of the screen.

Short version: If you need something inexpensive to run some web browsing and google apps, you won’t be upset.

B07GM2J11Q,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,8 March 2019,the United States,False,"So, disclaimer: I'm not a heavy computer user, meaning, all I mainly use a laptop for is browsing the web, using spotify and discord, and sometimes some Microsoft apps which i'll talk about.

Pros:
The battery can last a whole day of good usage, the screen quality is great, the keyboard feels nice, and my favorite thing: it's FAST! I was so sick of my slow as a** clunky hp laptop. It takes probably like 10 seconds to start up, and pages are quick to load. The laptop is a perfect size for sitting on your lap or putting in your bag, and it's really light to carry around.

Not necessarily ""cons"", just stuff that takes a little to get used to:
Like with any chromebook, most of the ""apps"" are just in another window of the browser. That being said, I managed to find a good add on to chrome for spotify and discord, but if you use other apps that you're used to on pc or mac, you might find that a problem. With microsoft apps, you could just use the online versions and they work fine for my student purposes. The touchpad feels a little inaccurate, but after some use, I got used to it. The two-finger scrolling and zooming feels nice, though. Also, the speakers are kinda washed out but again, I got used to it.

Actual cons:
It's crashed on me a handful of times already... normally, it's just a little annoying since it starts back up so quickly, but recently I had it crashed TWICE during an online midterm. Really though, that was just awful timing and otherwise I don't really mind it.

Any issues I had at first were gone after time passed. Despite the issues, I'm giving it 5 stars since it's such a high quality laptop for the price. If you're a student that wants something simple, I recommend it.

- Battery life averages an hour or two better than others in its class
- Super-thin bezels
- A sleek design with tapered sides makes it seem much thinner than it actually is, and its sharp edges line up neatly when the screen is closed or folded backward
- A fingerprint scanner, a feature normally only found on more expensive laptops in this size range
- Two USB Type C ports with Thunderbolt data transfer speeds and one Type A (traditional USB) port instead of the usual two Type A's and one Type C, making it more forward-looking than others but still backwards compatible
- Charges via one of its Type C ports, meaning that its charger also works with your phone if you use a recent Android and that your Android's charger will keep the laptop alive in a pinch. You'll only need to carry one charger for both when you leave home.
- Its one Type A port can charge other devices even when the laptop is turned off, so you can charge things with it without taking it out of your bag
- The touchscreen digitizer is made with tech by Wacom, a professional digital art device manufacturer, instead of by Microsoft
Cons:
- The downward-firing speakers are a little weird with the screen upright in a traditional laptop configuration
- The top section is flimsy and flexes a little if you're not careful with it
- The fingerprint sensor can really only handle one or two prints, and Microsoft's fingerprint settings menu is garbage: to fix or delete one fingerprint, you have to delete them all and start over
- No HDMI port, though you can buy an adapter and you shouldn't need one once monitors move on to Type C
- Not compatible with active styluses that work using Windows tech and not Wacom tech

It actually got worse. I was told I had to send in my device for repair. Ridiculous to have to send in a BRAND NEW DEVICE FOR REPAIR. It was less than 30 days old. Tried to return it and the retailer wouldn't do anything. Today I tried to call Lenovo customer service to see the status of my device. NO HELP AT ALL. Couldn't tell me when I'm getting my device back and only just kept saying I'm sorry and telling me what they were repairing. I WILL NEVER BY ANOTHER LENOVO DEVICE BECAUSE THEY ARE APPARENTLY PIECES OF CRAP THAT COME BROKEN AND GETTING THINGS REPAIR REALLY TAKES A VERY LONG TIME. I bought this device for school work and I can't use it for what I need because it is in the black hole of their repair shop. Bad service and crappy products.,0
B07CKNCQYX,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 September 2018,the United States,False,"Had to hand in my Surface Pro 4 after finishing work at Microsoft and bought the Yoga 730 as an affordable replacement.

THE GOOD:

- Love the keyboard - positive action, shallow travel. A joy after the bouncy clip on keyboard of the surface pro!
- Super fast startup and app start because of the fast SSD
- Sharp bright screen - but make sure you turn off the adaptive brightness (its easy in the Lenovo Vantage App). Adaptive brightness limits the maximum brightness in indoor environments to a level lower than I prefer. Consequently you cant get the best out of the screen. Would be great if Lenovo fixed this allowing you to turn the brightness all the way up regardless of ambient light level.
- Solid, minimalist construction that makes me feel this will outlast cheaper alternatives
- 2 USB C - Thunderbolt 3 ports - rare at this price

THE NOT SO GOOD

- 2 USB C - Thunderbolt 3 ports - if you need to connect to HDMI, VGA or a wired network, get used to using adapters! On the other hand it would never have been this thin and beautiful with all those connectors built in.
- The speakers are tinny and low volume - use headphones of get a blue tooth speaker if you want to listen to music or watch video. OK, most laptop speakers are bad, these just seem a bit below average.

Overall I am very happy with the purchase and feel like I picked up a bargain!

B07CKNCQYX,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,5 December 2018,the United States,False,"I read some of the reviews, and figured that, with the manufacturer warranty, there was no way a high proportion of the screens were so bad. I though maybe it was just a few unlucky people or bad screens. A month in, my screen starts to flicker, and, even worse, starts to intermittently fade out entirely or show rapidly flickering horizontal bands. When this is happening, it's like rows of pixels are being swapped and randomly moved to the entirely wrong vertical positions. Avoid this product!

Update: They did honor the warranty, and replaced the relevant cable (the one connecting the mobo to the screen I believe). They paid for the shipping, sent me a box, and made the whole process relatively painless. As a result, I am updating my review from 1 to 4 stars. It does seem to be a quality laptop aside from the screen issues. I will update this again if there is any further problem.",0
B07CKNCQYX,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,19 May 2020,the United States,False,"I'm writing this review about 2 years after originally purchasing the laptop for $730. I wanted a computer that was light, had good battery life, fast, and could double as a tablet. I've been pretty satisfied with eh computer despite a couple of issues. I wanted to share my experience below in case these issues would be a game-changer for some. I don't know if I would have purchased this model before if knew what I know now about it.

Unfortunately, this machine doesn't work very well as a tablet for an extended period of time. The computer overheats when it's folded in on itself. I never saw any performance changes, but it would get so hot that holding the device was painful. Also, when it's folded up there is nothing that clicks it into place or snaps the screen together. So it's hard to hold and maneuver as a tablet because it doesn't stay shut. There aren't any companies that I've seen making cases for Lenovo Yogas that help improves its function as a tablet-like holding it together while in tablet mode, or supplying cooling elements to help with the over heating. If I found a great case this may not be an issue for me.

I've enjoyed the use of it in tent mode for presentations and tucking into the back of a seat on a bus or train to watch a movie. The screen has a very nice display and the touch screen is very responsive. The computer is fast - I've even done some video editing on it using Adobe Premiere and I haven't had any issues. In general, the computer as a whole is solid. This computer's components and propensity for defects lands it my 3-star rating.

Cheap Dual Wireless/BlueTooth card:
I love using this computer to watch movies and youtube but because of the wifi and graphics card that I received with the computer (some Realtech network card), it cannot hold wifi or Bluetooth signals for long periods of time.
I constantly have to disconnect and reconnect to the wireless network to keep my internet going. And I can't keep the music playing from a Bluetooth speaker or headset for longer than 40 minutes. I had to buy a set of plug-in headphones that I use exclusively for this computer (thank god it has an audio jack). This is extremely frustrating. I've figured out that replacing my wireless card with an Intel one should fix the issue and I'll be trying that out to see how it works. I'll update this review after I've tried it. But It is very common for Lenovo to sell these machines with the cheapest cards out there. The one I purchased to replace the old one was only $20.

Flickering DIsplay
About 4 months after I got the computer I had the famous flickering screen issue. I had a 1-year warranty so I gave the computer to the people at best buy and they sent it off to and they fixed it but I had to go without my computer for about 2 weeks. It was all taken care of at no cost to me other than the inconvenience. They said its a typical problem and they had to replace my screen. So I recommend you ensure your warranty is good on this thing if you decide to buy.

One other small caveat: the speakers on the laptop don't play very loud. I knew this about the machine before buying, but I didn't think it'll be much of an issue since I'd use a Bluetooth speaker. (but then I rand into the problem I already listed.)

So here's my recommendation. If you buy this, plan to change out the wifi card and don't expect it to replace your iPad. Make sure you have a warranty for possible screen issues because there is a common defect in this model. For the price it being offered at now, it may be worth it. It would be perfect if it didn't have these issues. It's fast, lightweight, holds a charge for hours, recharges incredibly fast, but it has its issues. I hope that helps you make an informed decision.

B07BWF4H3W,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,28 December 2018,Mexico,False,"Rendimiento: Tiene un rendimiento muy bueno, la he probado en diversos programas y juegos, tanto utilizando programas como Photoshop y After Effects que demandan muchos recursos hasta juegos de esta generación como Injustice 2 o Shadow of the Tomb Raider con un rendimiento bastante bueno y decente. Parte de este gran rendimiento se lo debemos a Intel Optane, la nueva tecnología de Intel que mejora el rendimiento de nuestro HDD, haciendo que pueda almacenar información aun después de apagar la PC, haciendo más rápido el acceder a archivos o aplicaciones, ya sean juegos o otro tipo de software.

OS de fábrica: Si piensas comprar esta laptop debes de tener cuidado con el sistema operativo de fábrica, ya que puede dar problemas al momento de utilizar tu nuevo equipo, tuve que llamar a soporte técnico para saber la solución, la cual fue algo simple, solo tienes que realizar una instalación limpia de Windows. Por lo que recomiendo realizar la instalación limpia de Windows antes de empezar a utilizar tu nueva laptop y evitar problemas futuros por la versión del OS.
Nota: Al realizar esto deben de tener cuidado con los drivers, ya que a comparación de otras laptops, está cuenta con una secuencia específica, la cual puede ser encontrada en el foro oficial de MSI.

Pantalla: Aunque los componentes tienen un excelente rendimiento, el punto más débil de esta laptop es su display, ya que no cuenta con una buena calidad, hay ciertos ángulos que no se ven bien y la calidad de colores es regular.

Sistema de audio: Las bocinas de esta laptop pueden considerarse regulares, aunque al principio pueden parecer de mala calidad, la tecnología de Nahimic puede potenciar el sonido de nuestras bocinas, dándonos una mejor calidad de audio dependiendo de la situacion. Por lo que recomiendo darle un vistazo al programa Nahimic, el cual es exclusivo de la marca MSI.

Carcasa y teclado: Por otro lado, estéticamente es muy bonita laptop, con un acabado tipo mate, un teclado retro iluminado que tiene un control de luminosidad. Aunque esto tiene sus contras, ya que toda la carcasa es de plástico y tiende a ensuciarse con facilidad, sobretodo la parte superior la cual le quedan marcas después de tocarla.

Ventiladores: Tiene un par de ventiladores que podremos encender para la regulación de la temperatura para esta laptop, ya sea que tengamos de manera automática por medio del software de la propia laptop o por medio de un botón que tendremos en la parte superior del teclado. Cumplen muy bien con la función de sacar el aire caliente de los componentes.

Peso: El peso de esta laptop es relativamente pesado, no es tan facil de cargar a cualquier lugar y puede ser incómodo para el transportar diariamente.

Batería: La duración de la batería durante un día depende del modo en que la estemos utilizando, ya que puede ser solo 2 horas de duración si utilizamos los componentes al maximo o un promedio de 4 horas si estamos utilizando el mínimo de recursos.
Si quieres jugar y aprovechar el máximo potencia, te recomiendo que la mantengas conectada a la corriente para el maximo potencial de todos los recursos que tiene esta laptop.

Conclusión: Esta laptop es de las mejores opciones qué hay por el precio que tiene, aunque cuenta con un par de detalles como el problema con drivers o el OS, su calidad en componentes y rendimientos es muy superior a otras laptop del mismo precio, por lo que no dudes en comprar esta laptop, es una gran opción.

B07BWF4H3W,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,13 August 2018,the United States,False,"I bought this laptop for my brother since he is going off to college, but he is also a gamer who plays PC games. He has given me all the information for this review.

He says the keys felt very weird to actually use for everyday use like typing. Seemed to have a lot of resistance, but he is used to a mechanical keyboard.

The ram is very average, especially when you have multiple programs or tabs open in a browser. Can't go crazy in the tabs or else the ram will reach max capacity quickly. At least the ram can be upgraded, but doing it yourself will violate the manufacturer warranty. He says 16GB of ram would be preferred over the 8.

In terms of gaming, it will definitely not be able to run the newest games AAA titles at very high or ultra quality with the GTX 1050ti, but it will allow you play at medium maybe. My brother ran a program called 3DMark which is used for benchmarking computers by running simulations testing the CPU and GPU. He said the computer got an overall score of 1910 after updating the GeForce drivers. In the GPU tests, it got an average FPS of 10.84 and the CPU got 12.16 FPS.
He found this to be very weird as usually the GPU is better than the CPU in higher end computers. Also, the overall score is pretty low. A GTX 1080 would score on an average FPS of 44.69. As a quick note, these values are not values taken from actual games. FPS will generally be higher as a GTX 1080 can easily run 60 FPS and higher if not limited by a game. None of the components were overclocked either.

USB port count at 3 is lacking for some gamers. If you have a USB headset, a two USB keyboard, and a USB mouse, you will not have enough ports. As well as if you want to charge your phone or attach USB printer cords.

The speakers on this laptop are located at the end of your computer underneath where your wrist are when typing. They're not really good in quality or loud. As a gamer, you should get headphones anyway to have a better experience.

When the laptop came in, it was not updated to the newest version of Windows 10 Home. My brother had to update the OS and drivers for the trackpad. Could not scroll up or down on a webpage using two fingers on the track pad. He doesn't consider this a big deal as updating is normal. When he got a desktop from iBuyPower, the computer came fully installed and updated with Nvidia GeForce Experience and also removed annoying programs like Norton so you didn't get notifications.

Speaking of Norton, you get a 60 day free trial with Norton once the computer is activated.

Battery life is short when you are playing video games and running at 50% brightness. About two-three hours.

The cooling system is decent, but it is a bit loud if you are doing quiet work or in a quiet area. If you have noise cancelling headphones, you will be fine.

Overall, the computer for the price is good. I may have written a lot of negatives, but this was to tell other consumers what they should expect. When it comes to gaming, you pay for what you get. Laptops seem to be more expensive over desktops. Most brands are the same price except for those extremely overpriced like Alienware or Razer for the same specs. For the price, the computer will do its job. Run video games while also being used for college work.

B07BWF4H3W,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,11 November 2018,the United States,False,"I recommend this model to everyone that needs an affordable gaming laptop. It's fast enough with the characteristics that is has (although I'm going to add 8Gb of RAM in the future to have dual channel memory), the panel and the keyboard are very good, sound is surely above average (I'm using externar speakers so I don't care), the temperatures are excellent with MSI's Cooler Boost technology (I made a slight undervolt of 125mV in the CPU and it's always steady at above 3900 Mhz and the temperature is 35-45C at light tasks and in gaming is at most in the region of 75-80C which is perfectly fine and I did a bit for the 1050Ti in the range of 60mV) and it sturdy enough although it's made of plastic. My only complaints would be the really bad camera, the useless battery and that half of the MSI stickers from behind of the screen came of so I had to put new ones (not a big thing for sure but I had to mension it)...

A piece of advice: As soon as you'll open your laptop it's going to start updating Windows. What you have to do is download the drivers from MSI, especially ""Rapid Storage Techonology"" (for Optane), ""Intel Graphics Driver"" (mostly you need this for the camera to work properly after the updates) and the ""Dragon Center"" untility. Of course you should update all of your systems drivers and utilities, but those are critically essential.",0
B07BWF4H3W,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,11 December 2018,the United States,False,"MSI GV 62 8RD Review Intro (for free headset review purposes)

The MSI GV62 8RD is the best Laptop purchase I have made. With its tactile keyboard and top of the line Gaming Experience, I will be discussing everything I like about the Computer and the Cons of it which a very minute amount of cons.

Pros:

Keyboard: The keyboard on this laptop has helped me in many cases. Unlike the work laptops, I have had in the best the keys have been unsharp and as tactile as I need for my gaming purposes. With the feature of having the windows key on the right of the keyboard has helped me in many cases while gaming. The satisfying sound I here when I click the keys just help me and let me know that I am even clicking something which has happened to me in the past when I have been playing a game. The light red color it just so good-looking and I cannot get over how good it looks.

Storage: I haven't had a single problem with this computer storage wise and I most likely never will. With the feature of TWO, not one but TWO drives it just so reassuring and I can easily just get a 1TB hard drive if I run out which is in the LONG future, very far from now. I just love knowing that everything this PC has, will affect your FPS in-game.

Graphics/Performance:
I have not had a single problem in any game I have played yet in FPS wise and not saying I cranked the settings to the lowest possible for almost all the games I play with the highest quality possible and still get high FPS. I enjoy playing GTA with this computer as I would not be able to play like this with my old HP Pavillion I used to game with, which now I think of gaming with that computer it feels said compared to this beast.

Dragon Center:
Now, this isn't too big of a thing however I just love how much this helps me. You know when for some reason your computer is taking a lot of ram for no reason with just one click of a button everything is fixed and I can just go back with just freely using it. I know there is other software for this, however, I just love having this feature pre-built

Cons:
Well no RIG is perfect however this is near perfect I will be discussing the very small cons about this I can think of that I dislike.

Display:
This was only a problem when I first got the PC as my eyes were just used to my old display however the switch took a few days which was fine however it was the only thing I could think of, obviously now I am used to it and I LOVE it.

Backlit Keyboard RGB Support:
As far as I know I cannot change the RGB on this computer and that is the ONLY thing that is a problem for me right now, well not really a problem just one thing I dislike now I didn't dig on the Dragon Center and Steel Series software for long and I may be wrong but I am almost sure that you can't.

To sum it all up this is a great computer with few cons and anyone who is depicting whether or not to purchase this computer, I recommend that you go ahead and add it to your cart and order now.

After being with my laptop since 2012, it was time for an upgrade.
This MSI laptop was the perfect match for me. A price that wouldn't break the bank but it would also fulfill all my needs. I needed something with an SSD, a good graphics card and a powerful processor so this one turned out to be perfect.
It boots up in like 3-4 seconds, which is awesome. Windows doesn't lag and most important of all, they don't install a unnecessary programs that slow down your computer and occupy hard drive space.
I've been playing Overwatch quite a bit lately and this laptop can handle it with ease. You can also have a 4k monitor or TV hooked up to it which is another bonus.
Another cool feature was the button that allows you to turn on the backup fan and also open the ""Dragon Center"" where you can customize lots of different things.
The laptop feels solid (quality build) and it looks sleek and modern. So far I am loving it.

Luckily I had a warranty, though the people at customer service told me (as I am sure they are instructed to) that I did not. It took a long time of arguing, finally they agreed to fix it. They told me it would take them 7-12 days to fix, and I had to spend 220$ to buy a box to ship it in. It took over a month for it to get back. In this time I was on the phone with them constantly, it was horribly, they constantly assured me it would be back in a few days and it never was. THEN when it did come back it was still broken. I have been on the phone with them since, and it has been a nightmare. They said they would have some one local fix it, but they have not held up on that promise, and I am contacting them constantly trying to get them to follow up and often getting no response.

B07BPB158F,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,15 January 2019,the United States,False,"June 17, 2019: ASUS support tells me that I must send the machine for additional test/repairs. UNACCEPTABLE. The tech I worked with over a month ago told me that if the problem returned my machine would be replaced. I will not send this back in. The only acceptable resolution is replacement. I've lost literally months while this machine went back and forth to the ASUS repair facility and I'm still stuck with brick. I will never buy another ASUS computer. This is literally the worst computer purchase I've ever made and I've been using these things since the late 1980s.

June 13, 2019: THIS COMPUTER LITERALLY CAME BACK FROM THE REPAIR FACILITY FOR THE SECOND TIME LESS THAN A WEEK AGO and the issues have returned AGAIN. I'll never buy another ASUS product. This is garbage, the brand is garbage and I just want my machine replaced or money returned. This is absurd. If I could give this machine a negative rating I would...

I've brought my rating down to one star. You can see my original review after my update.
Update:
The problem with the fans grew worse. I tried updating all the drivers and this failed to fix the problem. I contacted support and spent about thirty minutes walking through the issue with them. They issued and RMA and I sent the computer out for a warranty repair. My computer was out for about three weeks and when it was returned to me, the problem was alleviated, but only for about a week, at which time the fans gradually spun up more and more frequently and for longer and longer periods of time. Right now, the fans have literally been running, and they are VERY LOUD for the past two hours. I'll close the laptop and the fans will spin down, but within half an hour, they spin up again. The computer actually woke me up last night when the fans kicked in (with the laptop closed).

I spoke to support again, and this time the agent told me the behavior was normal. Okay, right.

In addition, this computer's track pad is the worst I've ever had. It's almost unusable.

I regret purchasing this machine. It is absolutely the worst computer purchase I've ever made.

Original
I bought this computer primarily for a mobile DAW. In general, it supports everything I do in terms of audio recording and editing. However, there's a couple caveats I feel I must share with others. 1. The fans are running for no apparent reason. They are tremendously loud and in fact they've been running since I turned on the computer 5 minutes ago. I've disabled all but the essential startup items and currently I am running only Chrome. No other applications are running. The computer isn't even warm. It's really annoying. I was one version behind on the BIOS, so I flashed it with the latest. No change. 2. The track pad isn't great. Sometimes it's weirdly sensitive and mistakes a scroll for a click. Other times scrolling is difficult (it will scroll smoothly and suddenly stumbles requiring that I move the cursor to the side and try again. If that doesn't work I just go to the scroll bar and go from there.

So while the computer is suited to my needs, it's drawbacks are very frustrating. I'm considering sending it back.

B07BPB158F,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,26 May 2018,the United States,False,"Update (July, 13 2019):
I would not buy this laptop again! Some months ago, the fan speed started to behave like crazy. Even when the GPU is not being used, the fan goes to 7000rpm, making a huge noise. It happens several times during the day. Posts in the ROG forums and comments here shows that other people are having the same problem. ASUS support didn't help at all. They want me to send the machine for repair, but I live in Brazil and local ASUS doesn't offer support for this laptop. I would need to send it to USA, but shipping would be too expensive and I use this laptop for my daily work. I'm 99% sure this fan problem is a mix of bug in the BIOS + drivers + ROG Gaming Center. Unfortunately, it seems that I will have to buy another laptop, but you can be sure it will not be an ASUS.
----------------
Original comment:
I bought this notebook while my daughter was in USA. Since I live in Brazil, she brought it to me 2 weeks ago. I'm not a gamer, I'm a software developer, so I need a fast machine to do my daily work, and gamers notebooks usually fits this requirement. I was an ASUS fan back in the 90's, when I used to assembly desktop machines with parts from different brands. ASUS was my preferred brand for the motherboards in that time, so I supposed that ASUS notebooks would provide the same quality that I was used to, back in those days. Well, it seems that my expectations was too high. The machine is fast, of course, but I faced two problems that I would like to share: When you ""click"" in the touchpad, it is like there is something loose inside that hits the plastic chassis mostly where you stand your wrist, causing an weird sensation. The other problem is a ""high frequency"" noise coming from the notebook when the CPU is under some load. I searched the online forums, and this sound seems to be pretty common in ASUS notebooks, and they call it ""coil whine"" sound. It seems to be harmless, but very annoying. The loose touchpad also seems to be common for those notebooks. Unfortunately, ASUS warranty does not cover Brazil, so seems that I'll have to live with those problems. They are not showstoppers, but they should not exist at all in a quality product. Another problem was regarding the (mostly useless) ASUS support. I replaced the original SSD with a (higher capacity) Samsung EVO 970, meaning that I had to do a fresh install of Windows 10. I downloaded all the drivers from ASUS site, but I wasn't able to install the touchpad driver. In the end of the install, it always raised an error. I contacted ASUS support by chat, and they gave me all kind of useless answers, like installing ASUS live, send it to RMA (in my case, this would not be possible), etc. I was sure that there was no hardware problem, since the touchpad worked fine in the bios setup screen, and also worked fine in the pre-installed Windows on the original SSD. It took me more than a day digging into forums, etc until I finally found that I had to install the Intel I/O driver before installing the Precision touchpad driver. This wasn't mentioned anywhere. This solved the problem, but I wonder how ASUS support missed this information! So, I wonder if buying an ASUS notebook was the best choice...

B07BPB158F,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,9 June 2019,the United States,False,"This laptop is absolutely amazing - for the first 6 months.
Please keep in note I've had this laptop since December 3rd 2018 or around that date and I was putting a review on hold to test how long this laptop can actually LAST. I treat my laptops like children, I air dust monthly, wipe down with screen safe cloths, dont remove any of the components or overrun this beast. It's an excellent gaming laptop, but it can get a bit hot sometimes so I bought an extra fan to go under it to keep the interior dust free and more cool when I ran heavy games. Most of the time I dont run this thing to its max because it's a nervous feeling hearing it give it all. I dont move this laptop much, if I do, I never, never drop it.

So what happened? Well for starters, the laptop started to get a bit funky after 3 months, when I did add a little pressure to the system and play heavy games (Max settings on FFXV or Archeage, GTAV I never dared) it would unexpectedly blue screen and pop off. At first I was like ""Well okay I'll just lower everything, keep it on resting modes and no run it as hard next time."" Which worked, up until the next month where the CMD prompt would randomly spasm on the computer. Thought I had a virus and ran multiple security checks on it, turned out clean, left it alone.

Finally, the 6th month comes around, the screen just loves to black out frequently. Everything else is working fine, it runs and I even hooked it up to another screen to see that the computer itself is all good but it was literally just the screen causing issues.

This is the week that the screen never even bothered to come on, and I believe the screen is faulty after awhile for this particular laptop, as I've been reading up on reviews myself. No, I don't have warranty for this laptop as I know that I treat my laptops with the absolute care and protection than I probably do other living beings. So here I am stuck with a dead screened laptop that I wouldve thought would last a year minimum and over a thousand dollars lost.

Some people are complaining of a black screen after a week or two of use which is really unfortunate and should be fixed on Acer's part, but the machine itself is wonderful in my opinion.

Pros:

+ Light (1.2kgs), portable, fits easily in any bag.
+ Crazy fast boot times and storage speeds. Shut down to log in in less than 7 seconds. Having only an SSD helps!
+ The display is actually quite nice, I think. Good colors, small bezels.
+ Build quality is good, minimal keyboard flex.
+ Battery life is pretty damn good. I'm averaging about 7-9 hours with web browsing, and some video.
+ Trackpad is fairly large, responsive, Windows precision drivers, so gestures work smoothly.
+ Backlit keyboard is comfortable to type on.
+ Fingerprint scanner takes a little while to get used to, but now it works for me quickly about 95% of the time.

Mehs:

- Hinge is pretty stiff tbh, takes 2 hands to open the laptop.
- To my knowledge the ram is limited to 8gb, (though somewhere I read you can max out to 12 gigs).

In general, the experience so far has just been really convenient and quick. From the bag to logged in, ready to work takes only a few seconds and 2 months in, I couldn't be happier!

Has HDMI, USB-C, 1 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0, memory card reader, Bluetooth, 802.11ac wireless, full HD, stereo speakers, webcam, and headphone jack. The speakers are at the bottom, so if using it over a pillow or lap it could muffle the sound. It has one headset jack, like those on most smartphones. You can use it with regular headphones or with headphones with in-line microphone. Laptop also has microphone. It doesn't get hot, not even after hours of use. Has more than enough storage for me. Other than the speakers being at the bottom, I love everything about this computer.",0

The trackpad also freezes a lot. My main problem with this is the fan that goes off VERY loudly at random times (it’s pretty awkward and embarrassing when it does go off in class or the library).

Over time some of the plastic below the screen has started to break off. I've never dropped my laptop, so I'm not sure why this has happened, but it doesn't effect the way the laptop functions. I have had two big issues with this laptop. Not too long after buying the laptop my microphone stopped working. I have no idea why this is, but I cannot use this laptop for any zoom calls. My speakers work fine, it is just my microphone. This has been somewhat inconvenient for me, but the other issue is bigger. My battery life is the most annoying issue. This laptop came with one of the worst batteries I've ever had. My last laptop lasted a long time and the battery life started dying towards its fifth year. This laptop lost its battery life after one year! I couldn't believe how quickly the battery life died. I cannot rely on the battery on my laptop at all. It will say that it is at 80% charged but then just shut down on me, no warning or anything. It has gotten very bad.
The only other thing I can say is that the prongs that go into the wall outlet on the plug have started to blacken...this is a bit concerning but could just be from old age?
I don't work from my laptop, I just use it to do things at home and watch movies, so overall it has been okay for me, but this is not a great model. The battery life has also been something that I have gotten used to but is very inconvenient.

The keyboard is a pleasure to use and the touchpad is much better than other PCs I've recently used. The model I have has the standard 1920 x 1080 display which is fine for an ultraportable. Should you desire something comparable to a Mac Retina display, I recommend upgrading to the Lenovo hi-res HDR display. For typical business use - email, MS Office, web browsing, video conferencing, etc., the Intel 8th Gen i5 processor, 256GB SSD and 8GB RAM configuration is fine. The X1 also has a good array of ports including USB A-type, USB-C/Thunderbolt, and HDMI. After a few days of use, battery life is impressive -- probably 10 hours with web browsing, Office, and email usage. The only knock I'd give it in terms of hardware is the lid has a lot of flex to it, but I suppose this is to be expected since it's not aluminum. The other negative is not the fault of the hardware, but rather Windows 10. Setup was tedious. After going through multiple rounds of updates taking a couple of hours, I had to do a full reset and start over because the Start Menu would not save any changes. I would delete the Windows Games and other bloatware I don't need only to have it reappear. I am not set up on a domain where a Group Policy is doing this, so I decided to reset and that solved the problem. I also had to do a BIOS update and some Lenovo-dictated driver updates. After three days of use, all has been good. Within this price range, I have recently used a Microsoft Surface Laptop and a new Dell XPS 13 and prefer this Lenovo to either of those.

Also a bit disappointed that the function and control keys, though swappable, aren't physically swappable due to the different key sizes (with the control key coming up short after the BIOS swap).

Otherwise the battery life is fantastic, typing on the keyboard is enjoyable, and no complaints about the trackpad. The home and end keys, which I use frequently while coding, are in about a good a position as they can be I suppose, given the area limitation.

Lastly, the IR camera for face sign in is a subtle but lovely feature that almost makes me forget that it's doing any ""signing in"" at all. After a couple of times registering my face, it's very quick at recognizing me.

El sistema operativo y los programas están instalados en el, eso hace que se ejecuten en milisegundos, y el desempeño es muy optimo, la batería le dura unas 7 horas aproximadamente de uso continuo y forzado.

Pantalla de resolución 1920x1080, los PPI no tengo aun el dato pero no se logran ver los pixeles para nada, los colores están muy bien desempeñados, tienes unas imágenes de videos 4K espectaculares. El sonido no es la gran maravilla pero si lo configuras bien se escucha bien.

--Cosas en contra (que no importan mucho y se pueden resolver):
*No tiene puerto Ethernet ni VGA, no son necesarios al 100% y casi no se usan, pero si te pueden sacar de muchísimos apuros, o si realmente los necesitan en tu trabajo si afecta. Lo bueno es que tiene HDMI lo cual lo puedes transformar a VGA con adaptador, y también tiene un puerto USB tipo C 3.1 el cual puedes usar para conectar un Switch Output/Input con HDMI, USB 3, Ethernet, VGA, SD, MicroSD, USB C, y el Input de la corriente. Pero se te van otros $1000mxn.

*No tiene teclado retroiluminado y viene por defecto en Ingles (sin la ñ y demás símbolos necesarios), por lo que cuando instalas la configuración para un nuevo teclado Latinoamericano cambian los valores de las teclas, y te puedes confundir donde están los símbolos, ya que cambian de lugar y no son los impresos en las teclas. Es solo cuestión de recordar mentalmente donde están en un teclado Latino.

*La memoria de Estado Solido 128GB SSD, viene configurada por defecto como memoria principal del sistema operativo, eso es genial, el problema radica en que todo lo nuevo que des por entrada, instalaciones, películas, música, etc. se va a guardan en él, haciendo que se llene súper rápido.
Tienes que cambiar las direcciones de las carpetas manualmente al disco duro de 1Tb, lo cual puede ser un poco tedioso para las personas que no le mueven a la tecnología, pero es muy fácil.

En resumen:
Recomiendo que solo los programas que crean que usan mucho en el trabajo o escuela los instalen en la memoria estado solido para tener mejor rendimiento y rapidez, sino instalenlos en el disco duro de 1Tb para que no se les llene el de 128gb muy rápido ya que tiene el SO.
Es muy recomendable y a buen precio en Amazon, mas que en otras tiendas, ya las revisé. Sin duda una excelente compra, todo lo que puse en contras se puede arreglar fácilmente pero es para que tengan en cuenta al momento de hacer su compra.

B0795W86N3,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,7 December 2018,the United States,False,"I have a Sony Vaio that is going on ten years old - purchased in February of 2009. It's a very good PC, and has been my constant travel companion. So, it's beat up. It's got a 320GB HDD, a bluray player which no longer works because the s/w theft software is obsolete, and the thing is literally falling apart. For $1600, I've definitely gotten my money's worth.

Why am I telling you all of this?

Because this ASUS thing is the bomb!

It's SO much faster, even with an I5 and not an I7. The storage space is insane, with one TB, and the SSD is 128GB. 8GB RAM!

I loaded almost ALL of my programs to the new ASUS. The one that impressed me most was Dragon Premium 13. It's night and day difference. The Sony worked, but it was slow. The ASUS is nearly seamless, with over 99% accuracy.

All my video editing software runs, and faster! Everything is faster! I am really amazed.

Last year I was repairing DELL's, and bought a cheapie refurb on EBay for just under $200. It's a basic working laptop. But, it is built like a tank. (Model E6510, 8GB I7, just swapped in a Silicon Power SSD, now it rocks, too!)

The Sony is also very capable for air travel and has been very resilient.

The ASUS...well, it's too early to tell, but since I have it ensconced to be a dt replacement, I am not really all that concerned.

I have a Razer Blackwidow Chroma hooked up to it, and the combination is just wonderful. I can type again!

(I am a published author, and the ability to write fast is a key component to success!)

The keyboard on the ASUS - meh. Hook up a real mechanical clicker and you can go to town...but, the Dragon software, coupled with a Logitech H800, provides an even sweeter setup!

I can do 5,000 words per HOUR with this rig.

All in all, very pleased with this new PC. I will update next year, once I've broken it in a bit.

NOTE: It does take about a week for Win 10 to settle down, but I am also on satellite internet. The downloads and updates took about the same time to download. BUT - install times were mere minutes.

For example, I installed the MS Office Pro Suite, 2016 version, and Vision and Project 2016 - all in under 45 minutes.

AVS4You took about three minutes...

Good stuff!!

Edited to clarify a few things... 1/11/2019.

UPDATE - I now use this PC and two others daily, with Input Director software. It allows me to use the Razer and my Logitech trackball on all three computers! Loving this setup! Very productive! I wrote three 55k word novels since October!

The laptop comes without an operating system, so if you are Window-junkie like me, you may have to download windows 10 from Microsoft site (you need to use an empty 32Gb flash drive for this),and install it.Just put the USB stick in one of the two USB3 slots, and will boot Windows easily. No need for licence the first days (you just have a small sign on the right hand side of your screen that you need to buy a license) , you just have to order/buy a licence later on, there are very cheap licenses sold in eBay for very low prices.

They take 2-3 weeks to get the issue resolved, which is finally done by replacing my harddrive. Machine works fine for the next 3 months, after which it starts crashing again. This time the problem's been unidentifiable, and I've had to ship it back to lenovo to be fixed, which will likely take another 3 weeks.

The product simply isn't reliable, and nobody should pay $850 for a pc that will never work.

B076V6DPZN,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,13 November 2018,the United States,False,"Just like the Amazon title and product description says, I was expecting to get the Lenovo Yoga 720. But when I got this laptop, everything seem fine until I saw the sticker on it and it says the 730. I thought maybe they use the wrong sticker so I checked inside the system settings and it says the Lenovo Yoga 730. I wasn't even mad, I even went ahead to check the pictures of other reviewers who left a review on here and they all got 730s even when some of the reviews say they have the 720. So it's why I am writing this review to warn people that they are going to be purchasing the 730 and not the 720. Lenovo should fix this on this Amazon Page so they don't give people the wrong idea. It's why I am writing this review because I want to warn people before purchasing. This doesn't mean that the 730 is a bad machine, in fact I am kind of glad I got it. So here is my experience with it so far.

When I first got booted it up. It was a nice set up and it was quick and easy. After updating everything from bios to drivers (I recommended to do windows updates first and then download the official Lenovo Vantage software which will update your bios and drivers exactly to what device you have), it started to run fast and smoothly. As this is a convertible laptop, probably my favorite to use this is in tent mode while on my lap. Which is great if you just want to watch videos on this laptop. Also if you want to draw, it will be nice and sturdy on your lap while in tent mode. If you have just in regular laptop mode, you will notice that the bottom of the device will get a little hot. Since the intake fans are on the bottom, you are blocking it while it is on your lap which I don't like how that is design at all.

Speaking of fans, that is the only thing I dislike about the 730. If it's really being used while playing heavy games or heavy use like video editing, then it will sound like a airplane taking off! Like before I update everything, it kept running that loud constantly but after I update it stop doing that until, like I said, doing heavy uses with the laptop. So that's the only thing I dislike about it. Speaking of games, it runs smooth for the most part. That's why one of my screenshot is me playing Sonic Generations since I wanted to test if it can run and keep up with that game. Which it did run smoothly with a few jitters here and there.

But out of all those things it is still a great device. Keyboard is responsive, can easily bend it forward and backwards from laptop to tablet mode, and it is fast and smooth after the update. I am still a little bit dissapointed that it wasn't the 720 but I am still having a good time with this device and getting the 730 should not discourage you to not buy it.

B0752W6W4Q,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,5 August 2019,the United States,False,"I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I like this laptop. I've been using it for a month, and really enjoy its features.
PROS
1) My first touch screen laptop. I am surprised how much I use the screen. It is faster than a mouse, although I still use both. It's great.
2) Fingerprint reader - I love how quick I can unlock my computer using the fingerprint reader. Also, it works with my password manager, Dashlane. Saves time.
3) Tent and tablet mode - I wasn't sure that I'd ever use these modes, but it turns out to be handy. In tablet mode, I found it very convenient during Amazon's Prime Day sales. It has a larger screen than most tablets, and perfect for the Prime Day sales. I use tent mode to watch movies a little closer. The speakers are positioned in such a way that I can hear things clearly whichever way it is set up.
4) Pen - Well, I'm not yet fully sold on the usefulness of the pen. Maybe if I liked taking notes by hand or drawing more. Still, it's a nice feature to have.
5) Solid State Drive - now whirling parts on the inside, and it is cooler to run.
6) Fast, at least so far after one month of heavy use. I'm avoiding downloading too many programs though.
7) Speakers are louder and better quality than any of my previous laptops.

CONS
1) Two normal USB ports, and one USB C port. Since most of my components use regular USB, I had to buy a special adapter to use the USB C port. Still, three ports isn't enough, and the Lenovo pen holder uses one of the ports for stowing.
2) Small Hard Drive - with only about 250 GBs of drive space, I can no longer store the amount of photos, movies, etc. that I did on my last computer. No matter, I have a few external drives with several terabytes, but I wish my laptop had more space.
3) No DVD drive - But like my hard drive, I have an external DVD drive that I got for around $20.

In short, I really like this laptop and would probably buy a Lenovo again when this one eventually goes kaput. Hopefully not for many years.

The screen is too reflective. It is fine in low light and when there is a white background (which there typically is in most apps). I do use the laptop outside, so it is usable, there are just times when the reflection is too apparent, and interferes with seeing the screen.

It looks very sleek and feels very solid. When I sit in certain positions with the laptop on my lap (go figure), the edges cut into my hands or wrists uncomfortably. It doesn't happen often, but it seems very unnecessary to be so sharp.

Granted, I did buy one of the cheaper ones (it was a years ago when i purchased it but i was under $700 for sure) so I guess i got what I paid for. My issue with the previous laptop was that it was incredibly slow.
That is not the case with this laptop at all!

Intro: All I use my laptop for is for personal use-- Netflix, Microsoft Word, Excel for personal financing, Facebook, amazing shopping, Hulu, checking email, and storing all my pictures/videos.

PROS: Finger print scanner works well. No complaints on that. Its pretty fast. I haven't had an issue on the speed. Volume can go pretty loud if needed. When watching my shows on Hulu, i did not notice any fuzziness with the audio. There's bluetooth so I am able to connect my airpods! There's cool little features like being able to light up the keyboard (just the top keys), and flip the laptop into tablet mode. I only really use touch screen when in tablet mode and there's no lagging or anything like that.

CONS: The battery life is okay. Nothing out of this world. I've charged my laptop with it off for 3+ hours once, and it only went up to 99%. I feel like the battery runs pretty fast also.
The way the keyboard is set up, i find myself accidentally pressing the Caps Lock button a lot which can be irritating at times.

Very fast, responsive, lots of Android apps up and going. But ... I'm sad. I took my Chromebook to work, put it in a padded sleeve, put that in a backpack and off I went. The backpack was on a chair, accidentally got knocked off. I wasn't too worried because the Chromebook was in a sleeve ... and it's aluminum, too! But ... yep, you guessed it. It was damaged. The keyboard frame is still plastic, and not a very durable plastic at that. I am now the not-so-proud owner of a wonder Chromebook with a sizeable crack in the lower left corner. Sizeable. Noticeable. Disappointing! Why bother with aluminum if it's cheapo plastic that can't take a padded drop. Aaaargh. Machine still runs great, a little scar isn't going to change my thoughts about it. Just disappointed, that's all.

UPDATE: Have had this puppy now for several months ... my opinion has changed dramatically! This is a really nice laptop ... really nice! It's running Chrome 67 now, and purrs like a kitten. Fast, beautiful display, comfortable keyboard, and the Android apps work well (not great yet, but well). I'm basically using this as a Chromebook, not taking advantage of the flip and Android apps, and this alone makes me happy! I am a big ChromeOS fan ... it's grown up so nicely, so very useful!! Eventually, I would expect the Android side to catch up and work as well as they do on my LG smartphone and Asus 10 tablet (both are excellent!).

----

I am sad to write this review ... I had high expectations for the C302. Sorry for the ""downer"" start here, because as a Chromebook, the C302 is very good. Not excellent, but the best among the 7 Chromebooks I own. Yes, I am up to my 7th Chromebook. BTW, even the lowest priced Chromebook (about $150) is good ... just slower at doing what it does. the C302 is fast ... but buggy. I had hoped, with the addition of Android apps, that it would be both a Chromebook and an Android tablet. With future upgrades, perhaps that will still happen. But I write this review just after I have turned off the Android side of this laptop. It is NOT a replacement for a good tablet (such as the 10 inch ASUS ... outstanding tablet, BTW!! Really outstanding!). The C302 m5 (the best processor I could find so far, is a very good Chromebook. It is fast, but it is ... quirky. All of sudden, out of nowhere, it just ... blips. Perhaps I'm tapping the touchpad by mistake (don't think so) ... that would explain the random jaunts around the screen. So ... I've only had this honey for a few days now. I'm going to play around more with it and see ... is it operator error, or does it really have a mind of its own. I will update this review when I have more experience. On the plus side, it is fast ... very responsive! I am a big Chromebook fan ... I am biased, but I'm also fair. Pains me greatly not to report that this is an excellent machine.

So, after more use, guess what I found! (Oh, go ahead and guess!) When the screen is flipped 360 to turn the C302 into a tablet, the keyboard is disabled as you'd expect so when you put it on your lap, your knees are not typing by mistake! Except ... not all of the keyboard buttons are disabled. The up/down/right/left keys and some of the top row function keys are still active. So when I put it on my lap, my knees actually were having somewhat random impacts on the screen! Hmmm. Well, now that I found that out, I can be more careful. Still, a very nice compact Chromebook ... with quirks.

B074VB8VT5,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,3 July 2019,the United States,False,"As someone who works with technologies daily across a broad stratosphere of operating systems and equipment (Windows, macOS, iOS, Ubuntu and a myriad of other Linux flavors) - I have to say that this is my favorite ""tech thing"" I've bought. I was really on the fence.. and the price was a bit steep for to me was a top-of-the-line-Android-phone-without-a-phone, but I kept on reading the reviews and seeing the press so I had to at least try one.

I own 2 Microsoft Surface Notebooks (love them both too), a MacBook Pro & a MacBook Air, and a few desktops running various Linux derivatives. They are useful for very different things. I work in CG quite a bit, and for pure horsepower in a laptop the Microsoft Surface's are definitely the way to go (built in higher end nvidia GPUs). Pure horsepower for pure horsepower's sake can best be done at a desktop, but I like working from a laptop moreso than sitting at a desk all day. Having a full scale OS works great for certain things and a Chromebook will never be a full laptop replacement for that reason.

But this is what the Chromebook can do that not even a good iOS device can do: speed, speed, speed on ""routine"" tasks (email, web, Asana, Evernote, etc). It works - like an android phone - in that opening up gets you right to work. Even an iOS device with a lock code or face recognition process (or thumbprint or whatever) will cause a near minute delay in getting down to work.

This is important for a VERY important reason for me - at least. I still find that a pencil and pen, up until this purchase, was simply the quickest way to jot a note. No longer - I can type more legibly than I can write and with this device being simply wicked fast, I can open it up and I have Asana, Evernote and Google Keep open all the time and they just let me jot something down. This is Chromebook's ""killer app"" is that it just works, and works quickly.

Specific to this model, the Asus Chromebook, I am happy with the screen (it appears almost as nice as my MacBook Pro or MS Surface) in terms of color quality, radiance and overall clarity. It's not a large screen and the bezel is a bit thick around the screen. Asus did a good job of trying to keep it small without making the keyboard too crammed, and they didn't explode the screen to the edges likely for cost reasons. All in all, this makes sense - had this been a $700 purchase or more I would have just gone with Google's own offering.

The build quality is nice. It's up there with an Apple Macbook. My only complaint is that it's not super-thin (MacBook Air's seem to still have this niche figured out) which is useful when you have a space-saving travel need. But for the most part, you could write your next novel on this thing, carry on with code development (if that was done in a cloud based shell) or anything else you really need to and if you stick to the rules and try to keep most of your life in the cloud, you don't have to worry if you lose the device that you've lost your entire livelihood.

Bottom line? If you already have a notebook, laptop, desktop, and a myriad of other ways to get your work done, this is a great buy that'll introduce the ""fun"" back (just because it's so fast) into the mundane. 10 hours (and those are real hours, not a made-up number from marketing) of battery is a great thing. I'm not sure that this is a device for a student (I see a lot of people putting this into the hands of college kids) unless they are a CS major or just need a way to talk to Mom & Dad via email. While it's nice to have the Google appstore, a linux shell, etc., it's not going to be as flexible as a laptop in the end (like a MS Surface or a Macbook). To me, this is like the fun convertible to drive to work when I already have a truck or van in the garage.

B074Q54GSR,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,13 April 2018,the United States,False,"General Overall Review Before In Depth Review

Pros:

*Powerful graphics card at a cheap price
*Decent processor will get everything you need done fast
*Comes with a SSD over a standard HDd
*1080p resolution to watch Full HD content
*Backlit keyboard to operate in the darkness
*Not too heavy
*Has a nice exterior design
*Computer distributes heat well and fans keep it cool
*Can expand hard drive storage with HDD or SSD

Cons:

*Plastic material can make it feel cheap
*Fans get loud when playing graphic intense games
*Battery life is mediocre but if you use it as a gaming desktop alternative you'll keep the power plugged in
*250GB storage (I won't say it's a con exactly because of the price and because its a SSD. But if it was a 250GB HDD then I would list it as a con)

I paid $699 for this laptop. And for the price I paid I'm thoroughly impressed. This computer performs like that of a $800-$1000 computer. Has enough RAM to execute all your programs, 1080p screen, a decent i5 processor and a pretty powerful graphics card for the price. Everyone always worries about needing an i7 processor for gaming but in reality if your graphics card is insufficient having a powerful processor will not compensate for a mediocre graphics card. What people don't realize is an i5 is more than sufficient to game if you have a great graphics card. In comparison to my i7 Lenovo there's really not much difference in performance rather the difference lies in the graphics card. About 4 years ago I paid $1100 for my Lenovo Y50 which had a NVIDIA GTX 860M and an i7 processor. And because it broke I was looking around for a replacement. I was not really expecting much in regards to the graphics card especially because how cheap the laptop was. But surprisingly not only does it perform just as well as my previous laptop, it performs much better (new graphic card architecture and technology) at almost half the cost. At the time the 860m (the graphics card in my previous laptop the Lenovo Y50) was a mid range graphics card for laptops. But back then the laptop version of graphics card (m) was not on par with it's desktop counterpart and in most cases only performed about 40-70% of what it's counterpart could do. But now with the new architecture and technology the laptop counterpart performs at 75-90% of it's desktop counterpart.

The NVIDIA GTX 1050TI although a mid range card performs so much better than mid range cards back in the day. On a side note, if you plan on ordering this laptop make sure that it's the 1050 TI version and not just the plain 1050. The TI version packs a bit more of a punch which does make a difference. Because some people have complained and rated the laptop poorly because they received a 1050 version and not the 1050TI.

My only complaint is, the plastic material in which the chassis is made of vs the metal finish of my previous laptop. The plastic makes it feel cheap (well it is) but obviously it's more of an aesthetics issue than a performance one. Some people complained about the hard drive space being insufficient. To be honest if you're using this computer for anything but gaming the space will be more than sufficient. But if you plan on using it for gaming then the space will run out quickly, but for the price you're paying it's still a steal. Sure it's not a 1TB drive like a lot of standard laptops nowadays but because it's a SSD it will increase the overall speed and performance of your computer unlikes it's HDD counterpart. There is an extra hard drive slot so you can always expand the hard drive with a standard hdd if you're on a budget and need extra space or a 2.5 m sata II SSD if you want extra space with the continued faster performance. If you wish to add another hard drive you have to call Acer and request for an hard drive expansion kit, which they will provide to you free of charge (once you provide them with the laptop's information). Aside from that the only other con is it can be loud sometimes when playing graphic intense games but can be remedied by wearing head phones. The fans although loud does keep the laptop cool despite the plastic chassis.

Overall this laptop is a great purchase. lt packs a powerful punch for the price it goes for and looks nice as well.

Though the cheaper i5 included with this machine is still outstripped, power-wise, by my 5 year old i7 (with hyper-threading) the overall build of this budget acer gaming PC absolutely destroys everything else on the Lenovo performance-wise. The newer i5 is neck and neck with the i7, but the ""budget"" GTX 1050 Ti with 4 GB of VRAM (vs. the GT755M 2 GB VRAM) and 256 GB SSD make a gigantic difference in how games load and play.

Why do I call this ""Gamer Lite""? Well because this laptop really only comes with the bare minimum required for a PC gamer. You only get a 256 GB SSD, and 8 GB of RAM. The real excellent upgrade is the GTX 1050 Ti GPU, which is freakin stellar for a PC priced under $1000 USD. Basically, you get everything you need to run most AAA titles at High settings, ON A LAPTOP THAT COSTS $750 USD! 256 GB isn't gonna give you a lot of space for a huge library (obviously) but the fact that it is solid state makes it so quick. Win 10 boots in seconds. Steam opens literally instantly. Instantly! Not exaggerating. Kiss those long load times goodbye.
I did a lot of research before I decided on this laptop, and there are a few reviewers (YouTube and website reviews) out there talking a lot about heat. It is true, this particular laptop doesn't have the best design for cooling, but it is totally fine for normal use. I mean if you want to run a AAA title on Ultra settings for several hours then yeah, your CPU and GPU are gonna get hot and start to degrade. But this thing isn't for that. That's what a maxed out gaming tower with 10 fans and liquid cooling is for. Go buy that if that's what you want to do. I've seen external heat tests on this thing that look totally in line with what you would want from a performance laptop. If it gets hot then that means its time to go outside and talk to people LOL.
Honestly, great value for an excellent setup. Not the best. Not even by far the worst. At this price point your options are quite limited but this is really the best bang for your buck. And also, pretty nice to use just as a PC.

Laptop was new, in perfect condition and works like a charm.
AMD A12 processor is quite fast when loading everything from an SSD.
Light for its size, not much flex in the body.
EASY upgrade-ability!!! mem, hdd, screed, dvd drive are all easily accessible and removable.
The Model of this Laptop is the Lenovo IdeaPad 320-15ABR (it is not in the item description for some reason)

Complaints:
720p screen that's not very bright. Great if in a dark area but otherwise not that good. I have already ordered a replacement screen that is 1080 and brighter than the stock one.
Low RPM HDD. 5200 RPM 1TB HDD is painfully slow compared to an SSD. It should have come with an SSD or a higher RPM (7200+) HDD, but this is a cheap easy fix. I suggest getting a HDD/SSD caddy to replace the dvd drive, and have 2 storage drives. Again I already ordered that part.
4GB of the mem is attached to the MOBO of the laptop and 4GB is replaceable. (i Have never seen a laptop with half the memory soldered to the board and half swappable, not sure why Lenovo did this. Kinda odd.
Short charging cable.

B0748YG81P,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,4 December 2019,the United States,False,"Bought this for one of my good friends a month ago. She needed a reliable laptop as hers was on the way out. She loves it. I had to remove the usual bloatware but other than that it's a solid laptop for the price. AMD's A12 is no slouche for casual ganing either. She gets her work done, has lots of storage, gets to play WoW at an acceptable framerate and the webcame is of decent quality. I don't have anything bad to say about this computer. The only people who do are either expecting too much or got duds. It's a responsive machine.",0
B0748YG81P,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,30 June 2018,the United States,False,"This computer has two significant con's:

1) The drive is the traditional hard drive with moving parts, not the SSD higher-end computers boast of.
2) The battery was pretty limited. I couldn't get more than a 2 hr 15 min use from full charge to the computer needing to turn off.

The first of these was no surprise at all, of course. I mention it mainly to say it wouldn't have been a deal breaker for me, at all. The computer has a solid processor and enough memory to handle pretty much anything the average user willl throw at it, short of graphics-heavy gaming.

The second point *is* a deal breaker for me, because I occasionally need a machine that can last a half day without access to a plug. Amazon is being extremely reasonable about allowing a return and full refund. But as other users have also mentioned the battery life, I'll reiterate: it really is subpar for a machine with these kinds of specs.

That said: if you can deal with the short battery life, you're not going to find a better machine at this price. The case is solid and attractive, the keyboard responsive and comfortable to use (nice touch with the dedicated number keypad too!), the sound is much better than you see on budget laptops, and it booted quickly and handled running multiple programs including the resource-hog Google Chrome without a hiccup. If you're looking for a true desktop replacement or otherwise will have fairly regular access to an outlet, give it a try. I'm really sorry to be sending this one back!

B0748YG81P,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,15 January 2021,the United States,False,"PCs are useful only in as much as they boost your productivity. That sounds ridiculously obvious and stupid to even put into words. Yet it's a message I think more manufacturers need to hear. After less than a week with this weirdo little machine, my productivity was significantly and negatively impacted. This is the exact opposite reason for me buying a computer in the first place. I ended up returning it.

I don't know if I simply got a dud unit or if Lenovo should just be avoided altogether. I'll probably never know because I won't be buying another one. Three days was a long enough sentence for me.

I bought this computer because I did research and asked my colleagues who do similar work what they recommend. Many of them said Lenovo. I spent a little more than I have in the past for a PC because I wanted a high-functioning, fast computer that would last longer than cheaper versions. I bought a brand new unit, not a refurbished one. I spent approximately $800. On paper, it had everything I wanted. In reality, from the moment I started it, this unit was confusing, slow and disrupted my workflow nearly every second I was on it.

I also want to share that I am the purchaser of all computers and tech in my office. This computer was bought for work. I'm the Executive Director of a small non-profit, so we're not a large corporate office or anything, but we do purchase roughly 3 units a year. For what it's worth.

The problems with this computer were multiple, all of which I outline below. They range from annoying little quirks to full dysfunction. I can deal with the quirks of any manufacturer. They are not my major complaints here. I include them if they help other buyers make an informed choice.

Small stuff:

1) The charging cord does not have a light indicating whether it is actively charging or whether the battery is full. There's a very small light beside the cord but it can't be seen from the top.

2) The volume mute button similarly does not have a light indicating whether it's active or not. You have to push the button to see the control on the screen.

3) When I first booted up, I set a number passcode. That passcode worked once, then the system informed me that it wasn't going to accept passcodes any more and that I had to make a password. It literally read: 'This computer will no longer accept passcodes' or something very similar. Not a big deal but... why not? This is a funky little machine. And not in a good way.

Bigger issues that impacted my productivity:
1) It took forever to start up. The first time I thought this was just because it was brand new and needed a few minutes to get all systems running well. But no: Every time I turned it on, it took a full 5 - 6 minutes to get going. Any attempt to use any function prior to that resulted in a massive slow-down. I expect this from a dinosaur computer I've been using for years, not from a high-end PC that is less than one week old. It should be like a new car: The newer, the smoother. Here's a free tip to Lenovo: People buy new computers because they want them to work better than old computers. It's surreal to have to write that but I really don't think they understand this. If they do, they've done a poor job infusing that principle into their product.

2) Right-clicking anywhere caused the machine to freeze some applications. I pay for a MicroSoft license that is tied to my email that allows me the full Office 365 Suite on any computer. I logged in and activated this computer with 365, which is one of the two pre-installed versions it accepts (2016 also pre-installed). I then moved files from my old computer, which were on a fully functioning external hard drive, onto this computer. After transferring, no file operated in an easy manner. Even simply opening a file was often a really big ordeal and not always successful. You might think this was a MicroSoft Suite issue; I do not think so. For example, when I right-clicked any file from the menu to rename, I got the buffer wheel of death and had to CTRL-ALT-DEL to trick it into closing. I waited over four minutes one time just to see how long it would take then lost my patience. This happened EVERY TIME. Right click on a file would not work--it froze the entire MS suite. Similarly, when I right-clicked blank desktop to create a new file, same thing happened. I was not functioning in the MS suite at that time, just on the regular desktop. The result was a total breakdown in file naming, new files and file management in general. I tried multiple times on different days after restarting--it froze every time.

3) I also experienced stalling, pausing, slowness and freezing in MS PowerPoint, Word and Excel. It may be an MS Suite issue in these cases, but I have never had that happen on any other unit. This computer is the different variable, so I think it is this model.

4) Slowness also dogged my typing in the search bar on the internet. There was a 2-second lag between me typing and the characters appearing, sometimes longer. This resulted in me thinking my cursor wasn't well-aligned and trying to fix, then type again, which often led to mis-entered addresses. I have never had that issue with other computers--and certainly not units that were three days old.

5) Battery life was not as advertised. One of the reason I wanted a new computer was that my old one needs to be plugged in nearly all the time and it is not practical for my workflow. So I was happy to have 3 r 4 hours of battery life with this new unit. Nope! 1.5 hours at most even after a full charge. Most specs on this unit say 3-5 hours. I would expect the lower end of the that but this was 50% less than the lower end.

Biggest problem, which resulted in me returning it promptly:
For some reason, a massive update was required on day three of me using this computer. I was shutting it down nightly, so it's not like it was out-of-date. Plus, I had it less than one week... how out-of-date could it possibly be? The update itself was annoying but not the biggest challenge. That happened when the computer decided to restart itself even after I pre-timed a restart for 10:30pm.

Here's what happened: As I was preparing for a board meeting that was to take place four hours later, I was prompted for the update and given options to restart now or at a time of my choosing. I entered 10:30, knowing my meeting would last until 8 and I'd shut down after then. This was not a normal update that might take 20 minutes. It was at least an hour and likely more, as I would soon find out. But I thought I was in the clear, what with typing in the time I wanted it to restart and everything.

A few minutes after I picked the time to restart, I had an in-person tour of our facility (at a safe social distance). That took about an hour. When I returned to my computer, it had restarted and was at 16% progress for updates. The message under read: 'System updating. This will take a while. Computer will restart multiple times.' For the next 40 minutes, I waited. At that time, it was at a whopping 18%. I needed the PPT presentation I had created on this exact unit in less than two hours. I had not put it on a thumb drive or emailed it to myself because... well, I didn't know my brand new computer was going to restart itself in the middle of the work day so it could install massive updates on its third day of existence! WTF?

So I violated sacred law by shutting the piece of junk down in the middle of the updates because I needed my presentation. I had also decided in that very moment that I wasn't going to go to marriage counseling with this thing--I was ending it. It was already functioning terribly, so what further damage could I do to it?

It came back on and took another 20 minutes to calm itself down before I could access my presentation, which I promptly put on my hard drive and moved back to my old computer. And that is where I am typing from right now.

Lenovo's new computer makes me love my old HP.

Buyer beware!

B073WQLZ7M,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,2 February 2018,Canada,False,I was looking for a replacement laptop for an older Lenovo Thinkpad I have. I originally went to the Lenovo site to see what deals they had. After comparing specifications and prices I had decided to go with Amazon.ca. I got great 2 day service to the door and the computer works well. The initial setup was long but worth it. I can't believe how long the battery lasts.,0
B073WQLZ7M,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,11 December 2017,the United States,False,"After the screen on my HP laptop died I bought the exact same laptop. I was that happy with it. After a few years that screen died and then the keyboard died. No more HP laptops for me. Would love to have a Thinkpad, but that's to much $$$ for the likes of me.

This Lenovo Ideapad meets my needs perfectly. I'm use to Windows 7 so there's been a little bit of a learning curve when it comes to doing things and finding stuff, but that was to be expected. I'm not a gamer and I wouldn't recommend it for a high end MMORPG but obviously that's not what I bought it for. I browse, shop, email, occasionally stream a movie, create documents and spread sheets. I also run the PLEX media server on this guy and have no issues using the PLEX app on my Fire Stick TV to pull movies stored on my laptop to watch on my TV. More than enough machine for me.

The only issue I've had is printing. Sometimes it's unable to send printouts to the printer. Everything is setup correctly and the printer receives tests fine, but out of the blue it suddenly can't print from anything. I can still send a printer test fine. Network is fine. Default printer has current drivers and is fine. Trouble shooter can find no issues. I fix the issue by shutting down, powering off and rebooting. I suspect this is a Windows 10 issue so I didn't remove a star. Never had the issue with Windows 7.

I installed the free for everyone LibreOffice rather than trialing the expensive Microsoft Office. I've used it for years and it more than meets my needs. There's not much bloatware. Some low end games and Microsoft stuff - mail, messaging, maps and such - that I don't use and uninstalled. I've been a Firefox fan for years, but I'm trying to give Microsoft Edge a chance. Final decision here will probably be based on available add-ons.

I notice a lot of reviews complaining about updates taking so long. Truthfully, mine didn't seem to take that long. Besides, how is that the laptops fault? Windows needs to be immediately updated for any PC you buy and then continue to get updates periodically after that. That first update is always a big one. I live out in a rural area and on a good day my network download speed is a whopping 6MB. That is not a typo. I have no problem getting updates done or streaming movies. That said, if I'm doing some kind of big download then other things I'm doing do tend to slow down, but remember - 6MB bandwidth plus three of us in my home are using the internet at the same time. I also make sure nothing updates automatically. That includes all applications and Windows 10. Nothing more irritating than trying to do something and then some automatic update starts in the background and slows everything down or even makes your laptop seem to lock up. I just manually check for and start updates when I find it convenient to do so. I can but don't schedule auto updates to happen in the wee hours. Neither do I allow anything to send usage statistics or any other information up to its creators. Waste of bandwidth and computer resources. Something else I've noticed. Don't think I'm crazy. I don't know what it's doing, but if I leave my browser open to Amazon then my laptop - any laptop I've had - seems to run slower over time. I tended to leave it for days on end until I figured out what was going on. I resolved this by just not leaving my browser open on Amazon or at all for that matter.

Sometimes products have defects. It happens. When I bought my brand new Jeep ten years ago the electronic sway bar disconnects didn't work. How did I feel spending over thirty grand (all the bells and whistles) and it didn't work right? It took three frustrating trips to the dealer to get it fixed. On my third trip I made them replace the whole system. Fixed. I still drive that Jeep today. I like this laptop. It works great for me. I can easily recommend it for the casual user. I'll resolve that minor printing issue. Just know the specifications, know what you're buying here, know what you plan on using it for, have realistic expectations and you'll be happy.

B073WQLZ7M,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,3 March 2018,the United States,False,"I'd been looking for a half way decent laptop for under $500 that I could use in my hotel room while I travel for work. I ordered a Western Digital 512GB SSD from Newegg the same day I ordered this laptop and upgaded the main hard drive with this and did a clean install of Windows 10 then downloaded and installed the drivers for this unit from the Lenovo website. I'd read reviews mentioning the factory install of Windows wasn't the greatest and had issues so I chose to upgrade main drive and start fresh right off the bat. Since I had no need for an optical drive, I bought a hard drive caddy for the optical bay so the factory 1TB hard drive is now a storage drive. My next upgrade will be to add more RAM but as it is now this is a great laptop so far.

After traveling with this laptop for a little over a month it has been a great machine. It's not very heavy and it doesn't take up too much space in my backpack. The build quality seems pretty good and the keyboard is decent. I use it for web browsing, listening to music, and the occasional gaming. So far it runs SWTOR on medium-high. the Bioshock series on high, and Left4Dead2 on high without an issue. I haven't had the chance to try much past that but for what I do play it works perfect, especially when combined with a Logitech M510 wireless mouse.

Pros:
Good performance, especially after SSD upgrade
Easy to upgrade - the bottom of the laptop is a single piece so once that's off everything is accessible
Lightweight for its size - It's no Macbook Air but compared to my old Asus UL50 this thing is much lighter and makes it great for travel
Speakers - They won't blow you away but I've heard worse
Touchpad - Responsive and solid. The single piece design that manufacturers are going to is hit and miss. Some are terrible, others are great. This one seems to be pretty good so far. It's not so sensitive that the cursor jumps while typing too which is great.
Bluetooth - I use my Bluetooth headphones or speaker in my hotel room so the fewer cords on the desk the better

Cons:
Screen - My biggest gripe is the screen and its limited viewing angle but that seems to be the norm with these units.
Internal battery - Not a deal breaker for me but as the unit ages and the battery starts to go, it is built-in so the laptop would have to be disassembled to replace it.
Speaker location - I've got mixed feelings about this. They're on the bottom-front of the laptop which keeps the clutter down on the palmrest area, but if the unit is used on the users lap they become muffled. They sound better when the laptop is on a hard surface such as a table or desk which is nice when I'm not using my Bluetooth headphones or speaker on it.

Movie quality is beyond what I expected. It picks up new networks in a heartbeat! Never had disconnection issues.

I take my laptop camping with us as well. Its light, and pretty durable. The battery life is decent too. Granted not a all night battery life, but it lasts a lot longer then I ever thought it would.

I have been teleworking on and off this past year and again, no issues. This laptop just seems to keep getting better and better (Something Windows can take lessons on)

I had a few questions and the seller was FAST to respond! (Must of been using the Acer Nirto as well..hehe)

I am defiantly NOT disappointed and I think if you make the choice to get this one as, you wont be either! I let my son borrow it for a few days and he liked it so much, he got himself one a few months ago as well!

The LED IPS monitor is fantastic with wide viewing angles, deep colors, and a smooth frame rate. If you watch a lot of Netflix, YouTube videos, documentaries, etc., you're in for a wonderful experience.

The webcam is really good (even with okay lighting) along with a nice microphone and speakers, so if you do a lot of Zoom meetings, this laptop has you covered.

The build quality is good, and the hinges aren't too tight or too loose.

It has a backlit keyboard you can turn on or off whenever you like, and the typing experience is awesome. I type a lot daily, and this was one of my favorite things about this laptop.

I didn't use the touchscreen much, but when I did, it was nice and responsive. The same goes for when I used the laptop in tent mode and tablet mode.

The battery life was good but not super long-lasting e.g. 14 hours or something, even when I first got it. This wasn't a big issue for me though, and I believe it won't bother other people too much.

I used this laptop primarily for school work in college, some video editing using DaVinci Resolve, and live streaming on Twitch using OBS.

I noticed that 1080p 30fps was the highest it could go for video editing without struggling, and 720p 30/60fps was what it could do comfortably for live streaming. You can try pushing it further if you want.

Overall, I'd recommend this laptop for anyone who does a lot of work on their device and is looking for something versatile and powerful enough to handle those tasks.

If you're a student or someone who just checks emails, uses Microsoft Word, or maybe watches Netflix and YouTube, this might be overkill.

You won't be using a good chunk of the features this laptop has, so you're better off saving some money and buying something simpler.

****HOWEVERRR****
Apart from the dedicated graphics, the main reason I bought this laptop over other laptops was because of the Windows Ink Pen/Stylus compatibility. I was so looking forward to ditching my wacom graphics tablet in favor of having just a pressure-sensitive pen to write directly on screen. I had even went to Best Buy and tested this SAME model Asus with the SAME model wacom pen and it worked flawlessly. So why upon receiving this laptop does it not also have the same pen support?
After trying multiple ""solutions"" and failing, and extensive, exhaustive research online, I've concluded that the manufacturer is lying about their pen support, and that Best Buy has done some magical voodoo witchcraft for their displays to have ""Pen and Touch Support"", when in reality, this model only has ""Touch Support with 10 Points"". Even on the wacom website, they list only a tiiiiny selection of laptop models that for-sure support Windows Ink Pen input, which leaves many many laptops from various manufacturers telling lies about their compatibility!

So long story short - This laptop is totally rad. Great sound WITH THE Sonic Subwoofer thingy (without it its nothing special at all). But don't get it if you want to draw on the screen with your pen.

Then I booted it and expected to have all the Windows 10 Updates installed in the next 30 minutes as it would on my old HP and desktop which both have SDDs installed. The Asus would stall constantly! I pulled up the Asus support page and looked for troubleshooting. It read to keep rebooting it until WinRE appeared which eventually did. But it took several more reboots till any improvements in downloading and installing the updates. I do have TWC high speed cable which gives a good speedy connection. I worked on it from 8PM till 4AM till finally it finished. I tried their customer support but the agent's voice was so muffelled that I gave up.

I like the Asus brand and still have my old Asus model from 2011. It is rather large and heavy and won't run Windows 10, but I still use it as a backup. The best thing about this model is: it is so much lighter and has a lot of power. I can edit video on Adobe Premier, which uses a LOT of RAM, with no crashing or bogging down.
It is a standard size which makes it easy to buy a case- which I did with this order: I also recommend the Tomtoc Original 15.6 Inch Laptop Shoulder Bag. I travel a lot with my laptop, so a high quality padded laptop bag is a must-have. I left a review for that item, too.
I use all the keyboard features: volume controls, keyboard light controls, display brightness, etc. which are very handy. It can also double as a tablet.

B01LXYG77O,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,3 November 2016,the United States,False,"Very nice Chromebook for the money. I had reservations about the MediaTek processor before buying it, but it is much speedier than the Celeron N2830 in my Acer CB3-111. Based on Octane scores, and playing with my daughter's new Acer Chromebook 14, it's also a little faster than the N3160 by about 20%. One thing I was looking for when I read the few reviews that had been posted when I hit the ""buy"" button was how it performed with lots of tabs open. I'm happy to report that with 12-14 tabs open, including YouTube, Netflix, a couple Google Sheets, Amazon, and several others, it performs just fine. No stuttering video at all and each page scrolls quickly and smoothly. One thing I was particularly dissatisfied with on the CB3-111 was the time it took to reload the 5-6 tabs I'd leave open when it was coming up from a cold start. I ran it again today and it took over 3 minutes to load the 6 tabs (first world problem, I know...). With the Acer R13, it took 1:10 to fully load 12 tabs from a cold start, including the sites I mentioned above. I'm sure the 4GB RAM vs 2GB also has something to do with it, but the config of the R13 is definitely suited to keeping lots of tabs open and starting quickly when you turn it back on. From pushing the power button to the login prompt took less than 10 seconds also.
Now about using it as a tablet. It is a bit heavy, but in display mode sitting on your lap, this concern goes away. Every tablet I've owned has been in a case with a flap that let me set it on my lap like this anyway, just not a stable as the R13 in display mode. If you're carrying it around, the weight might be a concern. If you're looking at it to be a table you hold in your hand all the time, you might want to look to a Pixel C or a Samsung tablet, just be aware those won't do all a Chromebook can. I look at it this way. For $399, I get a strong Chromebook that runs all my Chrome-based apps in full native mode and a great tablet that can use all of my Android Apps (I switched to Beta 54 which enabled the Play Store). And it's all in one package. That definitely works for me.
Build quality seems good overall. It does flex a bit more than other computers I've owned, but it you treat it like a computer and not a block of wood, it seems like it will be fine. The screen is great! Very clear and bright with a warm overall tone. With Chrome you can adjust the resolution as needed for various sites/apps with CTRL+Shift +/- . Native resolution is 1920x1080, but it will let you adjust it from 2400x1350 (a bit over-driven) down to 960x540. I find 1536x864 good for a lot of sites. Battery is currently at 66% and says 6:44 left, which is a bit lower than the 12 hours advertised, but it arrived today, so of course I've been playing with it a lot since I pulled it out of the box (octane, speedtest.net, update to Chrome OS, switch to Beta, lots of YouTube, etc). I did fully charge it before using it. So far I'm quite impressed with this Chromebook. I also bought the Amazon Basics 14"" sleeve for this and it fits great. The 13"" would have been too small.
My last Windows machine that I was keeping around to run RosettaStone Spanish (it required the DVD Drive) for my son died about 2 months ago. We switched to an online subscription to Babbel Spanish instead - no more need for Windows... Everyone in the house is now on a Chromebook and I don't really see us ever buying a Windows machine again. Hope this has been helpful.

B01LXYG77O,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,12 March 2017,the United States,False,"I am a certifiable Chrome device fan. My fascination with Chrome OS began with an all plastic, low-end Samsung Chromebook in 2012. A long time Windows user and developer, I quickly became enamored with instant on, no fuss no muss computing. Gone were the seemingly endless time wasting updates and nerve wracking scans for malware. Since then, I have added an Acer 270P, Asus Flip C100, and Asus Chromebox to my list of go-to devices. I almost never use our 27 inch iMac with 5K Retina screen and cringe when powering up our Windows PCs.

I am developing all new websites using online themes like Divi, so I no longer need my PC only Artisteer or Mac-Centric RapidWeaver programs to create and maintain responsive sites. My workhorse Acer 720P was starting to lose a little battery life, and I longed for a better display. After much research, I opted for the Acer R13.

As many have noted, the screen is lovely, the fit and finish of the case, feel and function of keyboard and trackpad are impressive. Pages and files load quickly and WiFi connections are solid with no apparent attenuation from the metal case. So far, battery life seems to meet published quotes of 10 to 11 hours. As with most Chrome laptops, estimated remaining power is frequently recalculated. The R13 takes updates of remaining battery life to a maddening extreme. One minute it may inspire with an estimated 7 hours and the next a depressing 5 hours. It shifts enough to limit it as a useful estimate of remaining run time. My astigmatism forces me to spend an inordinate amount of time adjusting and testing different resolutions and find the 1536x864 setting with a page zoom of 125% yields the best text clarity for me.

The R13 is frequently described as heavy. It does have a bit of solid heft to it, but I would not characterize it as heavy. After draining the battery to 3%, charge time to full was approximately 2 hours. Some complain that screen brightness is limited, but from one who often lights a room with the glow from his computer, I find the screen at max to be too bright to use for extended periods. Audio volume is a tad lower than that of my Acer 270P but loud enough to share music and videos with others sitting close. Bluetooth syncs quickly with my LG headset.

The R13 is one of the Chromebooks listed by Google in line for Play Store Apps support, but as of this review, the only way to install apps is to switch to the Beta channel. The only app of interest to me is Skype, and I can wait for stable channel support.

The Acer R13 is an excellent laptop computer and has become my La-Z-Boy computer of choice. Recommended without hesitation!

Update: With almost a week of daily use, the R13 has never disappointed, Battery life is close to 10 ½ hours. Charge time from lows around 3% remaining life to 100% is a bit less than 2 hours. YouTube videos and MP4 files stream without hiccups. As of this update, the Play Store is not available on the stable channel. I switched to beta and downloaded the free release of the Power Director, video editor. I am familiar with the PC desktop program and impressed with features, responsiveness, and ease of use of the Android app. I decided I could wait for the promised stable channel release and reset the R13 to the stable channel. The R13 has become my preferred laptop for entertainment and work. I spend much of my time developing, and maintaining websites using the Divi theme and Divi Developer plugin. I am literally using the R13 while comfortably seated in a Lay-Z-Boy recliner where the fan-less cool case is appreciated.

UPDATE 8-30-2017

My Acer R13 Chromebook just updated to Version 60.0.3112.112 (Official Build) (32-bit) and enabled Play Store access using the stable channel. Long wait but as I look through the store none of the apps seem particularly appealing. 8-30-2017

It's fast, light weight & runs cool as I'm not feeling any heat & handles loads well for what I'm using it for. I'm not a fan of windows10, but if I feel the need I can change that later. I figured I'd give it some run time before posting a review as it's been a month now. Great lappy if you can handle the right shift key, built in battery & wall wart for a power supply but I knew that before I purchased. As far as battery life & web cam you'll have to hit another review as those are 2 things I don't need to worry about. All in all ""Great lappy"" & I got what I expected. Radeon R5 graphics is more or likely a miss print as it's R7.",0

B01LNOEKWK,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,3 September 2017,the United States,False,"Been using this laptop for a while, it's a decent laptop, I really like it but I have a few complaints:
- For some reason images online take FOREVER to load. We have not been able to figure out why, but none of our other computers have this issue.
- The colors kinda suck. I have to buy a color calibrator to get true color profiles. (As an artist it's a bit of a requirement)
- The up arrow is directly to the left of the right shift key. Because of this I am FOREVER pressing SHIFT+UP instead of SHIFT+?, it's incredibly annoying and a terrible design choice.
- The slick surfaces of the laptop pick up dirt and grease easily. It just always looks greasy, no matter how much you clean it.
- The track pad is TERRIBLE. It uses 2 finger scrolling and will click on things when you are only trying to scroll, it's very frustrating.
- The battery life is very short, and the battery is built into the laptop in such a way that I can't replace it with a better battery...

I'm sure there's other annoyances I can't quite remember at the moment, but overall the laptop is alright. It's decent enough for basic use, and the price isn't bad. I do have some issues with my art programs crashing. I'm not sure what's causing that... but it seems like I can work on art and stream/record while doing such. For the price, it's not bad.

B01J42JPJG,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,28 March 2017,the United States,False,"This device is a good value.

I had reservations about the convertible package, but it is well done. The hinges are cleverly made to give good friction and geometry throughout the range except the last little bit in either direction. Then the lid sort of snaps into place as it is closed or fully folded back. The unit is off-white or beige- colored. There is a nice texture to the finish. The unit is light enough to carry between thumb and fingers. There are no fans. Warming is minimal. Battery life is somewhere well beyond 7 hours and charging is quick.

The touchscreen is sensitive and smooth. The keyboard is comfortable and has a decent feel. Despite some of the criticisms by others, I find the touchpad to be smooth and responsive. One thing I learned quickly is that the pressure on the touchpad has to be very light. For example, if your finger pressure is too high, the cursor sort of sticks. The two-finger stroke for scrolling up and down when viewing document or a webpage works very well in lieu of a mouse thumbwheel. Just lightly brush the touchpad with the 2nd and 3rd fingers. Most of the chromebook multi-touch gestures seem to work. I haven't had consistent luck with the two-fingered tap for right-click, but ""alt + single-tap"" does the same job. ""Tap to click"" is sensitive, which can cause problems if you tend to drag palms on the touchpad while typing.

I connected a bluetooth mouse, which I prefer to a touchpad for moving the cursor. Logitech M557 (large mouse) and Verbatim 98590 (small mouse) work fine, without evidence of the sleep problems experienced with Windows. The chromebook mouse interface doesn't seem to support adjusting thumbwheel sensitivity, which is one reason the two-fingered touchpad gesture for scrolling is valuable. The only mouse adjustment is pointer speed. The special Windows button on the M557 pops up the App Launcher. Between the touchpad and the touchscreen you really do not need a mouse with this system.

The display is just ""okay."" I operate it at full brightness. It is a little bit sensitive as to vertical viewing angle. The resolution is adequate for most purposes. In the tablet mode, in portrait orientation, I could comfortably read a full magazine page of the Economist, for example. This involves very small print rendered as an image rather than as font. The lower resolution causes a gentle blurring of the print in this situation, when compared to the crisp display on my Nexus 9. (Zooming the magazine display in laptop mode seems to be a better alternative.)

Speaker volume is excellent. Half volume is about right for watching a Netflix movie. Dialog clarity is fine.

Many of the android apps I care about work fine, and this will probably improve with time. This fact makes the chromebook a nearly complete replacement for a laptop. Nook**, Kindle, 3M's Cloud Reader and Overdrive android reader apps work fine, and the device makes an excellent ereader, offline or on. The Microsoft Outlook android app works fairly well, with some quirkiness. About every 3rd time I send something it encounters an error and, fortunately, saves the message as a draft. Excel, Word and OneNote android apps aren't compatible with this device. The online equivalent apps work fine, although starting up the OneNote application seems slightly clumsy.

My unit came loaded with File Commander by Mobi Systems. I installed android OfficeSuite Pro, made by the same people, in order to provide an off-line office system other than Google's. OfficeSuite Pro integrates with File Commander and can access GDrive and OneDrive and can open password-protected files. File Commander offers a scheme for transferring files to a PC via wifi. ( ESS File Explorer offers an FTP interface I think is better.) File Commander insists on having access to contacts, maybe for ""sending"" files to others.

I could not get HP's eprint scheme to work but was able to install HP's ""All-In-One Remote"" android app. This software enables printing to and scanning from my HP C8610 printer while connected to my home network. Printing is only for pdf files, but the Chrome browser, OfficeSuite Pro and other apps support printing to pdf as an intermediate step.

It looks like this is going to be a 95% replacement for my laptop, especially when travelling, and I am very happy that I bought it.

** Nook's reader is touchy for me. It breaks if one tries to read a book in two-column mode in a maximized window. Minimized, it works fine either in two-column or one-column mode. I haven't found that magazines are affected.

B01J42JPJG,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,22 September 2017,the United States,False,"I rarely write reviews. I mostly do video reviews, but never of specific products. That may change here soon.

This this is awesome and has quickly replaced many of my gizmos and gadgets, some that have cost me upwards of thousands of dollars. People who complain that Chromebooks are useless without internet access clearly are narrow minded and simply not thinking outside the box. Allow me to explain:

Let me begin by saying I take tech seriously. Since beginning a journey into a lifelong passion of filmmaking and screenplay writing I have invested tens of thousands of dollars of my own money into PC's that can keep up with the demands of 4k video editing and post processessing. I have amassed a couple of decent PC's, one a custom desktop (still being built; $3K~) and another an ASUS 970m ROG Laptop ($1300~) that are great for exactly what I need them for. My desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and my laptop is great for editing video and running PC games in places other than my home (like school!). Recently, I've really gotten into writing more and I've found myself coming up with ideas on the go and wanted something a bit lighter than a 10lb ASUS Laptop (that thing is a monster). So mind you I really ONLY purchased to type down ideas as I had them, Seriously. I wanted something I could work on my writing projects on the go, so I paid the $250 for this thing. I just wanted a mobile typewriter. But oh my... I had no idea how far the rabbit hole went,

When I recieved the item I was amazed at the quality of it. I've had my fairshare of ""eBay Special"" aka Cheap Chinese iPad knockoffs (seriously, I've owned atleast 8 I think over the past 8 years) and have found each one to be a complete waste of money. Either they were so slow I couldn't get any work done or they just flat out broke after a couple months. I even broke bad and bought an $350 iPad and returned it not too long afterwards (I grew to dislike Apple products as they don't play nicely - or cheap - with just about anything else I own.) I was weary about paying this much for another iPad wanna-be tablet, which has an OS that doesnt go with anything, from a company that specializes in WalMart consumer PCs. But just at first glance, this thing is top quality. Nothing on it feels cheap at all. Not the glass, the display, the aluminum cover, the plastic. All of it feels very strudy (within reason) and has a nice, modern look and feel to it. I feel like this will look good in any decade. Very futuristic.

I boot it up and notice quickly the display seems to be 720p (or something close) but for what I need this thing to do... who cares? I just want to type words on it. The touchscreen and the hotkeys along the top take some getting used to but I was quickly in the Google Play Store, downloading all the apps I have on my phone and linking them to my accounts.

""This thing is neat."" I thought to myself as I was scrolling through Facebook, listening to Pandora and playing my cloud save of Falloiut Shelters. I became a wizard, learning to use the touchscreen, keyboard, and touchpad all in tandem. I prop the thing up to watch a Youtube video.

""This thing is really neat.""

But oh yah! I was supposed to use this to write! So I went to install my favorite screenwriting app, Trelby, only to find its not available. Darn. I use some other apps but nothing is quite the same for my workflow.

So I got desperate and booted up Linux on it. After some headaches and code learning, I quickly abandoned the stupid idea when it became more trouble than it was worth and factory reset. I thought the gizmo was neat but I was disappointed that I couldn't really use it the way I wanted to it that regards.

This is where the R11 gets interesting. I quickly realized that I could use the Google Remote Desktop app to access my desktop computer. BAM! I was writing on my scripts at home! I was using my whole $3k desktop on this little $250 laptop and it ran flawlessly! I could even watch videos and game from the laptop itself (to an extent). THIS IS AMAZING! But... If i wanted to use it on the go... I would NEED that internet connection to access the files. Man... maybe those negative reviews are right. Maybe this thing does suck without an internet connection....

Except everyone in 2017 is carrying a little WiFi router in their pockets. It's called a cell phone and even my cheap $30 ALCATEL has a tethering option.

And just like that, I realized that I can use my studio desktop wherever I want, whenever I want. That is just incredible. For $250 I can control my $3000 PC anywhere. She's got a USB for a tactical mouse and external keyboard, an SD slot and an external HDMI output. This thing is the ultimate mobile workhorse. Sure, it wont completely replace my ROG Laptop is terms of what it can do on its own but the ability alone to access my own desktop and use it as a touchscreen laptop is just amazing.

This is the ultimate tablet. This thing is amazing. As a matter of fact, I wrote this whole review on it. Buy it for school, buy it for home, buy on for the grandkids. Cant go wrong on this one.

La batería dura bastante y se puede usar, sabiendo como sin señal de wifi en muchos casos. La recomiendo sin duda! Mi mejor compra hasta ahora en Amazon.",0
B01J42JMQ2,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,16 October 2016,the United States,False,"To begin with, I knew going in that I was getting an android operating system that would not have all the functionality of Windows, especially MS Word. I have a 13 inch Win10 HP Spit with an i3 processor and so that is my comparison. My objectives for this laptop were:
1) Lighter weight with a screen 13-14 inches. I have used 11 inch models and found them to be too small to enjoy surfing the net. 13-14 inches is perfect. This machine satisfied both my weight and screen size needs. The HD resolution is nice and futureproof but at this screen size do not expect a quantum leap. It is, however, very good.
2) Reasonable fast web page loading. The Celeron 3160 and 4G ram closely matches my HP i3 for speed.
3) A strong internet connection. The ac WiFi with 5g connection is a great addition and something you don't get in older models. Is it strong, yes. Is it faster than my i7 8G ram Dell, no, but we are talking $500 difference. Don't buy a Ford Fusion and expect it to perform like a Porsche.

I have had Q&A on this Chromebook asking if it will download MS Office. No. Google Docs gives you word processing capability and you can see and work with all of your MS Office stuff, but you cant easily go back and forth to MS Office. Keep in mind, you have to pay $ for MS Office where Google Docs is free.

Some significant differences for me versus Windows were:

1) I needed to find a mouse that was android compatible. A couple of my older and expensive Logitech mice just would not work. Logitech now has mice that state compatability with android and says so on the box. Watch that if you are a mouse person. I found a reasonably priced mouse at Costco that works fine. The touchpad works great if you prefer.
2) The tab bar icons are really small. You can blow them up but you have to change the screen resolution. Check it out at Best Buy to make sure that you can live with it, The drop down bar on the Favorites tab give regular size views. Web pages can be blown up the same as in the Chrome browser, so no issues there.

Overall, the way I see it, I'm getting a big screen HD android galaxy tablet with a keyboard for the price of a tablet. It does not allow download of all the apps on the android tablet or phone, but Google is working on that. For $300 it's a great machine for web surfing and basic computing and a major improvement over older Chromebooks. I have i3 and i7 WIn10 laptops for my heavy duty stuff. This acer is a web surfer that's easy to travel with.

B01J42JMQ2,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,18 February 2017,the United States,False,"This is the first chromebook I have had! I have had a Windows computer, and I am an avid Apple Mac lover and user!

This chromebook is a beauty, love the gold color! This Acer 14 Chromebook is snappy! Comes on quick and shuts down quick! Switches between pages quick!

I am learning how to use it, the only thing is that I just wanted to transfer some things over from my mac to the chromebook by using a flash drive, I actually had to just open google docs and make tables and add all the information. Took a bit, but I think it will work well!
I have only had this for a few days, and have been at work, so not to much time to learn all! But so far, I like it!

I did order a 128 gb flash drive for the Acer chromebook for storage! I don't like the idea of paying Google Drive for storage, I can take my flash drive with me for access to my files.

The webcam isn't all that good, and Skype on here is not the best! I tried to Skype with my mom last night and she said that the video was not good at all, and after a bit she froze up on my end. She will share her screen with me so I can help her with her Macbook air, and she tried to and it would not share on my end. Oh well, I do have an iMac and an iPad that I can use, and I can also Skype on my phone!

I will adjust to the changes between Mac and Chromebook. I did also have to adjust to Mac from Windows and fell in love with Mac. I will probably end up loving chromebook also!

I mainly purchased the chromebook to see if and when my husband and I would be able to switch from Mac to Chromebook! We have had our Macs since 2009 and no issues other than my iMac needing a hard drive, after 7 years of use. My husbands MacBook pro, no issues! I am hoping that we will be able to do everything that we normally do on our macs, on the chromebook!

Update 2-27-17 I have had this Acer now for just about 2 weeks and am learning how to work all the things I was trying to do before! I just took my usb flash drive and uploaded into google sheets and there it all was. I am just in love with this Chromebook! I could have several setting around me and would be so happy! I have it on all the time I'm home and wished I could take it with me when I go to work, (But I would not get anything done at work for being on this).

I would highly recommend this Acer 14 Chromebook!

UPDATE 12/29/18
I still use my Acer daily! It is still quick in response, start up and shut down, switching between pages are quick! You would never think that I have had it for about 2 years! A windows computer would have been slowed down! I would say that you still need a regular computer for certain tasks, like for us it would be for getting into our Apple airport and maybe printing pictures! But this chromebook is awesome for daily use! I love it!
UPDATE 1-1-20
Still use my Acer Chromebook to this day! I have found out that it is just a little slower than when new! But it is almost 3 years in and it isn't enough that I will reset it to factory settings {I did read that if you do the power wash it will bring it back to being just as snappy as when first purchased}! Still love it, everything I need it for it works perfect! I can see myself using it till it dies! Who knows when that may happen!

B01J3TZT8Q,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,11 April 2018,the United States,False,"I've been using a chromebook since 2011 and I love the experience (more below for those who haven't used one)! This particular chromebook is the priciest one I've purchased, but also the nicest one! The gold color is absolutely gorgeous, the screen is crisp and HUGE. The feel of it is amazing. It is heavier than either of my previous two chromebooks, but that is to be expected since it is made of better materials. I know this will sound silly, but I feel super fancy using it, which makes all the school work I'm doing 10x more enjoyable. Eventually that will wear off, but for now I'm using it to get ahead in all my classes!

Chromebooks in general
You can do anything you can do in the cloud. I've gotten a master's degree and am working on a second one, while using a chromebook. I wrote all my assignments and several novels in Google Docs. The only thing I want to do that I have been unable to do in the cloud is work on screenplays--I haven't yet found a cloud version of a service I like, but I also haven't checked lately, so it might now be available.
Super portable - I have always gotten incredibly battery life with a chromebook. They also tend to me slim and light, so easy to throw in a bag.
Cheap - While some are more expensive than others, they are cheap enough that when I inevitably smash (drop onto concrete juuuust right from like 5 feet) or lose it, I am not devestated and can quickly replace it.
Easy to switch - If all of my stuff is saved in the cloud, I don't need to worry about losing anything when I replace my current chromebook, just sign into the new one.

The previous, very large, laptop is still going strong after 6 years so I decided to go for HP again. I am not disappointed. This laptop is incredibly light and slim. The design is good, the build feels solid and despite its smaller size it packs a punch. It is strange getting used to the fact that you don't have the traditional usb drives but if you buy the specialist adaptor there is a usb connection one end and a c-port at the other end which fits into the laptop (c-port seems similar to your mobile phone charger port). Away you go! In order to maintain its feather weight the optical drive is ditched but, again, use your adaptor mentioned above and you can connect an external optical drive which is cheap and very light and compact. It operates in the same way as the integral optical drive in your old desktop. You can also get an adaptor to link up with an HDMI cable. I like this new firmware and it takes very little time to get used to- even for my very mature generation!!",2

B01CVOLVPA,JJJ,5.0,Best Chromebook on market for the money.,19 January 2017,the United Kingdom,False,"I've had a lot of Chromebooks in my time and never really settled on one that I actually like and want to keep, but this is actually the one finally.

Don't go for the cheaper version, get the 4gb ram version with the faster processor. It's worth it. Snappier and doesn't get bogged down with anything (unlike a lot of the cheaper versions).

So what's great about it?

The build. I have a macbook pro retina as well, but wanted a cheaper device to take out with me and use for writing and surfing. It's not as good as the Apple, but it's close. Really close. It feels much more expensive that it actually is. I have the gold version and I love it.

The battery. I easily get over 10 hours. No problem at all.

The size. I actually love the 14"" screen size. Since launch, google has fixed the screen resolution blurriness issues too, so I can set it 1536 x 864 so get nice size text and icons without any scaling issues (looking at you windows). The screen also tilts back 180 degrees, so you can use it flat, which is handy when laid down and propping it up on your knees (ok - so I'm sometimes, weird and lazy).

The keyboard. I write a lot. I've tried a ton of keyboards on laptops and this was one of my main drivers for choosing the right one. This one is spacious, light and I actually prefer the textured keys over the glossy ones on the MacBook Pro. Not backlit, but I touch type, so I don't care.

The trackpad, doesn't pick up any grease, super accurate, large and easy to use.

Performance. As mentioned, the cheaper Chromebook do struggle at times, few tabs open, playing some videos, everything can get just a bit choppy. Not so with this. You can't do anything too taxing with a Chromebook anyway, but this thing just works. I open it up, type my password and I'm away.

What's not so great?

Screen brightness - it's not as bright as the Mac, but I never have that at more than 40% brightness anyway. I have the Chromebook at about 50% and that's plenty for me. The screen is matte though, which counters a lot of the glare other laptops get, so not really marking it down for this.

The speakers... they're downward firing and just meh. I use headphones if I'm listening to anything though and it's just fine for that.

There's no SD card slot. This might bother some people. It's doesn't me. I never use it.

There's other Chromebooks coming out this which look better on paper. The Samsung Chromebook Pro and the Asus C302. Both converitbles, touch screen, Core M processors, blah blah blah, but I think they also both miss the point somewhat. They're double the price of this and yes, they'll probably run Android apps better because of the touchscreen, but Android apps aren't great in general anyway. especially on tablet sized screens. This is easily the best Chromebook I've ever used and I love it. I reach for it before the Macbook more often than not.

Amazon doesn't have this model. Currys/PC World does. It's also available on the Acer store. Get it. You won't regret it.

B01CVOLVPA,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,1 December 2016,the United States,False,"I've kept an eye on Chromebooks for the last couple of years as a possible option for a low-cost laptop. I'm a long time Windows user but started using Chrome as my browser of choice a few years back. I also have an Android phone that's tied to Google's services and appreciate how well the user experience transfers between the phone and desktop. After an honest evaluation of my laptop usage habits, I decided a Chromebook could meet my needs.

I'm not a gamer and use my laptop primarily for email, web browsing, and light document work. I also have Linux and Windows workstations on my network and access them via SSH, VNC, and RDP. I'm been quite pleased at how well the Chromebook has worked for all these tasks. The free SSH client from the web store works to logon to my Linux machines and can even do public key authentication and port forwarding, enabling me to tunnel my VNC connections through SSH. The Chrome RDP app also works well, connecting to my Windows machines with good performance, and I can access files on my NAS using Network File Shares After using the Chromebook for the last couple of weeks, I'd confidently recommend one for everything but gaming and special purpose applications.

The quality of this unit exceeds my expectations, and if feels solidly built while still very thin and light. The keyboard and track pad are both quite good, although I always use a real mouse. Battery life is excellent, and I can get several days use before needing to plug in. With a solid CPU and 4GB of memory I can run a dozen or more open tabs with good performance. I'm not sure just how many things I need to open to notice performance degrade because I haven't hit that point. Saving the best for last, the full HD screen is one of the primary reasons I chose this Chromebook, and it is wonderful. Scaling works nicely when needed using either Ctrl with mouse wheel to scale just the browser contents or using Ctrl, Shift, +/- to scale the resolution of the entire screen. I've shopped around for Windows laptops with higher resolution screens and they are all well beyond this price point. To me, this Chromebook is a great value.

Il monitor essendo un FHD impressiona per risoluzione/definizione e luminosità per me adeguata in tutte le condizioni (anche in esterno). Materiali premium unibody d'alluminio finitura opaca il tutto veramente bello ed elegante. Unico neo le casse, essendo posizionate sotto producono un suono un pò ovattato e non tropppo potente.
Mi dilungo un secondo su chrome OS; prima cosa importante da sapere che è un OS cloud based semplificando un grande browser tuttte le app sono sviluppate su questo concetto rendendo poco pratico l'utilizzo off line, non dico impossibile perche sarebbe fuorviante ma se pensate di utilizzare il chromebook come un normale notebook siete in errore. Il sistema è veloce e reattivo il processore Intel Celeron Quad-Core N3160 riesce a portare a termine rendering delle pagine web e piccole elaborazioni decentemente, ma da una cpu a basso consumo è sbagliato pensare di ottenere di più.
Guardando al futuro con la possibilità di poter installare il google play le potenzialità di questo chrome book sicuramente si amplieranno a dismisura!
Per il mio utilizo direi un ottimo acquisto!

B01AS8SK6Y,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,13 December 2016,the United States,False,"First thing I wanted to say I bought this from another store since Amazon was out of stock on 12/11/2016.

I wanted to review it here since I normally buy everything from Amazon. I'll also list the specs, since they have various models. It works perfect for what I use it for. Which is just streaming, web browsing, and basic picture editing (Not Photoshop) . Bought it to replace and old computer I made 3 and a half years ago and extremely happy. I do not use this for gaming, I have a PS4 PRO for that.

The version I bought had 2 displayport out, 125 SSD, 8GB of RAM and 4 USB 3.0 ports in the back and 2 USB 3.1 in front. Also got the speedy dual core Intel chip rated at 3.2ghz no turbo boost. Picked up a displayport to HDMI adaptor from Amazonbasics to connect to my HDMI monitor. It also includes a Bluetooth 4.0 and Wireless AC card.

Everything loads rapidly, my internet is 100 down and 15 up and I also use a Dlink USB 3.0 adapter, not the default AC card since it's only a duel, while my adapter has a 3 antennas in and out. I tried the built in wireless card and works fine, but I already had a better/newer adapter from my last computer.

I would recommend a SSD due the rapid loading of startup programs and general speed increase. It's also very quick to load the OS from a shutdown sequence. Some units have the SSD as optional or more space with a HDD but if you're not using for gaming, or storing various programs like steam games or tons of images/video. (I mean a lot) Choose the SSD option. 125 is more than enough for everyone and if you have an external HDD that should fix the small storage space. If you need more, you could buy a 256 SSD for about $60-$90 later down the road. Trust me, the SSD is worth having, I had a traditional HDD for over 10 years and did not know what I was missing till now.

(They were not joking about the SSD speed boost). And I can never go back to tradition HDD again.

It's tiny, I would say about the size of a small book. I made sure to buy an Intel chip that had a higher GHz similar to my previous build (3.2 GHz) If you buy a model with slighly different RAM (4GB vs 8GB), or (SDD or HDD) you could buy upgrades later. Crucial Memory also says it can be upgraded to 16GB RAM instead of 4-8GB.

My unit came with Windows 7 Pro (Downgrade rights). Since i'm past the free upgrade from Microsoft themselves. I was able to get Lenovo to allow me a download of W10 PR OS FREE or optional USB shipped to your home. That information is included inside a pamphlet, while Lenovo does make it easy to create your own USB Recovery drive, it did have a few errors, luckily I was able to let it keep downloading after reporting it. Beyond that, I have to say I am in love with the computer. Simplistic, easy to use and nice on the eyes.

If you decide to create a recovery drive of W10 PR OS make sure it's USB 2.0 or 3.0 with at least 20GB of internal memory left, I used a 32 GB just to make sure I had enough space. The USB drive will allow you to reinstall the OS if you have any issues. After that, it can never be used for anything else but revive and install the Operating System. I have about 2GB worth of images, 2 GB of music high resolution not MP3s on the system and about 2 GB of wallpapers for the desktop. The rest is backed up to the cloud (music and pictures) and I have a small 125GB Samsung metal USB 3.0 thumb drive for images and pictures that I plug in to transfer anything to my computer.

I had 87 GB of 117 GB left on the system. I use a USB thumb drives to store massive files since it frees up the computer from having to store everything and transfer when I need to edit or listen to music from a USB thumb drive. Like I stated, I'M A VERY HAPPY with the unit, if you're looking for something speedy, small form factor, with tons of bells and whistles. This is it. If you need an HDMI for your monitor, you can buy a displayport to HDMI wire from Amazon. The unit comes with 2 displayport, which is similar to HDMI and transfers audio and can also be used on a 4k computer monitor.

The webcam is pretty unusable given the placement on the bottom left of the screen. I use an external Logitech webcam to resolve the issue. I'm also not a huge fan of trackpads, even though this is a good one in comparison, the laptop really benefits from being paired with a Logitech MX Master Bluetooth mouse.

B018FSX3KM,Victoria,1.0,1.0 out of 5 stars Useless Dell USB-C adaptor and Dell customer service,5 October 2016,the United Kingdom,False,I have bought a lot of Dell products over the years but this is definitely the last. Customer service is utterly abysmal. I had to buy a USB-C adaptor to HDMI/VGA/Ethernet/USB 3.0 DA200 because I do a lot of presentational work.

The Dell, being solid state, fires up almost instantly, the screen resolution is excellent, and battery life is very good (although I haven't tested it to its limits, only to about 8h).

B0186JD544,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,20 May 2017,the United States,False,"Bought 2 for my team recently. Having used myself for a long time I knew Thinkpads are built for software developers in mind but how easy it is going to be to upgrade I had no idea till I opened the back cover. As soon as you open back cover you see all (two) slots for the RAM are available (since machine has 2 slots under the keyboard - factory installed RAM used those slots which was very smart idea imo). Same thing with SSD/HDD. There is a slot left open for you to upgrade. You can put 2.5"" (classic) SSD or use same spot for (up to) 2 M.2 SSDs. Do not forget to buy casing for M.2 SSD if you are planning to add M.2

I bought 2x16GB RAM, and 1 TB M.2 SSD .. With one slot still available for future M.2 SSD .. As you know thunderbolt can support up to 4 monitors or an external video card supporting 4K monitors .. This laptop is built to serve you for a really long time! A wonderful piece of hardware .. Awesome job on Lenovo's end.",0
B0186JD544,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,22 November 2016,the United States,False,"If you are looking for a Thinkpad P50 this is configuration to get - the base model. The laptop has easy access to the hard drive and ram so you can upgrade it yourself for much cheaper.

I had Thinkpads in the past and currently have a Retina MBP. I decided to come back to Thinkpads since they are a bit cheaper and much more upgradable. The fit and finish of my Macbook Pro is better but the build quality of this P50 is still very good. The P50 however is much bulkier than a 15in Macbook Pro.

Heres why i choose this P50:

Screen: The FHD screen is IPS and has good color and view angles. I prefer this to the 4k option because of increased battery life and no issues with scaling.

Ram: 8GB is ok. The laptop has 4 slots 2 under the keyboard and 2 under the back panel. The back panel is pretty easy to access and you can upgrade to 64GB of ram (16x4)

Hard Drive: The included disk is slow. You will want to upgrade to your own SSD. This laptop can take 2x NVME and 1x 2.5in drives or 2 x 2.5in. If you get an ssd thats a 2.5in just drop in place of the existing hard drive and you are ready to go. However if you want to add an NVME or another 2.5 drive you will need to buy an adapter which is annoying. I swapped in an 256GB ssd I had around and it was noticeably better than the spinning disk.

Graphics: You get two options with the P50 the M1000M or M2000M. This has the M1000M which is marginally slower but I don't really game or do anything graphics intensive.

OS: I was initially hoping to run linux on this but I read about some compatibility issues. I settled on running Windows 10. If you also run Windows 10 make sure to turn off the MS snooping features. Don't use express settings.

Overall I'm pretty happy this P50. Solid build quality and runs pretty quickly after you upgrade the Ram/SSD. The only complaints I have are the non center keyboard (they should drop the num pad) and the need for adapters for adding hard drives.

• Sluggish day-to-day operation I'd expect from an entry-level machine, Despite 8GB RAM and 2 Samsung SSDs: Glitches and annoying little pauses abound when switching tabs and windows; video playback gets glitchy, especially on YouTube; whole computer becomes unresponsive when external HDD spins up.
• Doesn't always sleep when I close the lid. Today it overheated in its case; choking on its own hot exhaust; now fan won't stop spinning at full RPMs (annoyingly loud).
• Bluetooth can't keep a connection and occasionally the hardware disappears entirely from device manager.
• USB 'dedicated charging port' on rear repeatedly connects and disconnects phone when computer is on
• Audio functions appear on both dedicated keys as well as on fn keys. What a waste of four function keys; so many other functions I could have used!
• The touchpad and trackpoint controller are among the worst I've ever used. TrackPoint used to be my favorite control method. Not on this machine.
• I thought the keyboard would have the textured keys I'm used to but mine shipped with smooth keys, which don't feel as nice.

I though for sure there was a hardware problem so I took the machine in for repair as soon as I could in Manhattan. Presumably they changed the motherboard and keyboard but all the symptoms persist until this day..

Yes, I am up-to-date with drivers, BIOS, etc.
Yes, all my settings are as they should be.

So disappointed. I really hope Lenovo steps up on this one because I've got myself a lemon, here.

This kind of hybrid intel / nvidia optimus tech setup has massive issues on linux, mainly due to the poor quality of nvidia's provided drivers.
I suspect that I will never get an external monitor working, or if I do, it will be a massive undertaking.
I tried to set the BIOS to just always use the nvidia chip, but this seems to cause the primary laptop screen not to work. I suspect the intel chip is hard-wired to the laptop screen and the nvidia chip is hardwired to the external interfaces.
Note that (even on windows) you can only use one external monitor at a time.

I made this purchase specifically looking for a laptop with a good discrete graphics card without Optimus, which is what the advertising appeared to show.

B0167W1VAM,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,20 January 2017,the United States,False,"I bought the IdeaPad 100s because it was selling for less than two-hundred dollars on Amazon, and because it had an HDMI port (so I could play movies from the IdeaPad on my big screen HD TV). The HDMI functionality works fine, as I had hoped, but I actually figured the IdeaPad would be kind of a cheapo PC. Two months after buying the IdeaPad, I do not think of it as a cheapo PC; I'm very happy with it.

First off, it is very light in weight, so I am now bringing it along with me to on-campus college courses. Second, the built-in WiFi works very well. Third, the battery lasts for six to seven hours on a single charge. Fourth, I had no trouble making the IdeaPad visible to the other devices that use my home router (both cabled and wireless). And by using the Windows 10 homegroup functionality, I can share files and configuration settings between my desktop, IdeaPad, and other devices.

There were a couple of issues, both of which I was able to resolve fairly quickly. When I turned on the IdeaPad for the first time, the display continuously pulsed between average and maximum brightness. This problem was resolved by setting the monitor to maximum brilliance in the Windows settings. The IdeaPad also had a problem with tracking time. The system time kept falling substantially behind the actual time, even though I had Windows set to automatically update the time and the timezone. This problem was resolved by applying and flashing a BIOS update from Lenovo (free dowload).

I am particularly delighted by the light weight, very long battery life, and the ease in using the Wifi capability.

After browsing around I came across this Lenovo. Suits my needs. I needed MS Office and the ability to install Firefox & Chrome for school. I'm not into gaming but I use this mainly for word processing and document uploading. Lightweight. Cute color. Quiet and YES the battery life is a 10. If you need an affordable option don't hesitate. Now, I've had a Sony Vaio before. Loved it, but I worked it to death and I used it for business. This Lenovo compared to the Vaio had a plastic feel when my wrist contacted it but what do you expect for 175? Not a deal breaker for me and I may get a gel wrist pad if it becomes an issue. I do really like the keyboard feel. This is a laptop you take right out the box and you're good to go. Windows 10 was easy for me to navigate and I'm not that computer savvy.

B0167W1VAM,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,7 December 2016,the United States,False,"Great little powerhouse. Got a mini-sd card to help expand the memory, which I'd recommend if you want to keep a lot of files on hand locally. The edges on it can be a bit sharp against your hands/wrists if you rest them while you type, and some of the keys require a firmer than usual touch when typing. For the price, though, this really is a great buy.

Easy to use, can hold and run quite a few somewhat older games--not enough memory for a lot of brand-new big names, but anything that only needs a few GB to install has worked great for me so far. If you just want something to ramble around on the internet on that can do more than just a basic chromebook (some image editing, reading, word procession, Excel, etc.), this would be at the top of my list of recommendations. It travels well, and the battery life can stretch nicely if you play with the settings a little; especially if you're using the included Microsoft Edge browser. I'm a devoted Chrome user usually, but streaming video through Edge I can make it through half a season of a show before it gets to halfway drained. Obviously that changes depending on what you're doing, but especially at this price point I am very pleased with its performance.",0
B0167W1VAM,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,13 January 2016,the United States,False,"I bought this netbook because my kids' school assigns so much internet and computer-based homework that we needed a second laptop. It works fine for its intended purpose (homework for elementary and middle school aged kids), but I would not want this to be my personal laptop.

The Bad:
The matte screen is not good for watching videos/movies/streaming, and I definitely would not want to try to edit photos on this machine. The keyboard is unpleasant to type on (the keys are awkwardly shaped and sticky, so it takes a little concentration and banging, which I'm not used to needing to do), and the trackpad and buttons are the pits.

The Good
Price: As a basic internet-based word processor/research tool, this fits the bill just fine, and the price for a reliable machine is hard to beat.
Good looks: This is a pretty little machine, and certainly doesn't look like my clunky workaholic Lenovo T-series.
Zippy: Internet searches are fast and smooth on our home WiFi. Despite the less-than-stellar screen, streaming video is no problem for this machine (as long as you don't mind the matte surface and poor resolution).
Versatile: I like that we are able to use Microsoft Office products and Adobe on this machine, as well as Google-based documents.
Expandable storage: I'm not a fan of cloud-based storage; I just don't trust it. So I like that I was able to add a 128 GB SD card to the card slot and there are plenty of USB ports that allow me to plug in flash drives and external hard-drives for additional versatility.

Tl;dr This netbook won't replace my work-horse pro laptop as my go-to, but it is a good little machine that worked right out of the box. It's expandable storage and the ability to use Microsoft Office products make it a really good deal at under $200.

B013OO0GHA,Anonyme,2.0,Sans titre,7 April 2016,the United States,False,"I really wanted to like this computer, I really did. On paper it seemed like quite nearly the perfect computer. Small, compact, decent battery life, it had almost everything I wanted. Did it have a dedicated video card? No, but for the size and price that's an acceptable tradeoff. I ordered it from a certified Amazon seller and waited for my laptop to come.

When I got the package, my initial disappointment began. The seller made no attempt to hide the packaging. The laptop simply came in the manufacturers box. Completely exposed to any would be thieves. That was extremely worrying from the outset, but that's not the fault of Amazon, it's the fault of the seller and the box was in good condition so that really didn't bother me after my initial shock.

The computer came in good physical condition, no scratches or dents of any kind. The computer booted promptly thanks to the 256GB SSD included. Which was awesome!

That's about where the compliments end however.

The material that this computer is built with is a cheap, faux-metal, brushed material that does not feel or look good. It also attracts fingerprints, grease, and really any substance like it was designed with that function as its purpose. The backlit keyboard is nice in theory, but the way its executed on this computer only adds to its mediocrity. The placement of the power button is sort of bizarre as well. It's a small button on the side of the laptop meaning that the computer can be turned off and on while its in the bag. Strange choice in design.

The core issue that I had with this laptop is the defective touch screen that my unit came with. After looking it up, it's a problem that numerous other users had with this exact same laptop. The screen would registers multiple touches even though no one was touching the screen. This problem is easily rectified by disabling the touch screen through the control panel, but that doesn't really help if you wanted to actually use the touch screen does it?

The keyboard is another mediocre affair, the keys have very little travel and are squishy when pressed. It's a very unsatisfying experience. This added to the fact that the keyboard attracts a great deal of finger prints and grease do not make up a great experience. There are thinner laptops and less expensive laptops that provide better experiences.

I was going to keep this computer, I told myself that I was making something out of nothing and that I needed to just deal with the faults of the unit as a result of the cost (which wasn't a bad price.) But the overall poor quality of the unit as well as the defective screen was really just unacceptable. Lenovo doesn't make terrible computers, it's unfortunate that this one drastically misses the mark.

B00VQP3DNY,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,28 November 2015,the United States,False,"So I have had this chromebook since last August, I believe, and I think that I've had it long enough now I can give an objective review!

I actually, to my surprise, really like this thing. Here's why:
1) Portability. I can take it everywhere. It's lightweight and starts up immediately.
2) It's as quick as the day I got it.
3) No malware worries. Period.
4) Battery life-excellent. Easy 6-8 hours or more.
5) Google Drive and Docs- this is increasingly similar to MS Word, and for those who don't have to use MS Word, like for school, it's a completely suitable replacment. Additionally, when you buy one of these, or at least when I did, you get like 1TB of storage on Google Drive, which is awesome. There is a drawback to Drive, however, and I list it further below.
6) Quickly resets when overloaded. I had an acer laptop before this, and after 6 months, it was basically unusable. Even with malware protection and everything. First the charger messed up, and I think maybe I fixed that with a new one, though it still sometimes doesn't recognize the charger and dies unexpectedly. And if you do get it working, it IS THE SLOWEST LAPTOP EVERRRRR. It has plenty of RAM. And there's really no obvious reason it is so slow. But it is seriously excruciating to do any work on it because it freezes constantly. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH THE CHROMEBOOK. Every once in a while, the chromebook gets overloaded (I tend to open too many tabs at once), and the screen goes black for a few seconds, then it comes back up. Period. Every time. Occasionally, it will shut down the Chrome browser, and ask me if I want to restore it. But that's it. No slowness, no freezing. It is amazingly reliable in that way.
7) User-friendly
8) If you need any help or don't understand something about your chromebook, google the question and you're likely to find an answer quickly. I always have.

Here are some of the drawbacks however, to owning a chromebook. And these are important, because while there are positives, there are limitations as well.
1) Google Drive sometimes is inefficient. Sometimes I will try to open a document and it won't open. This is infuriating to say the least. This is partially why I still use OneDrive, I like it better. Even though I can't install the application on the chromebook, I go to the site, and the documents ALWAYS OPEN.
2) MS Word Online is just not that great. Granted, it's awesome I have access to it. But I am a grad student, and being unable to put headers and footers (it can be done, just is a huge hassle and not editable like in the application), as well as work with margins is a huge minus. Bc it's a chromebook, I can't download and install applications, which has it's positives and negatives. This is one of the negatives.
3) Google Docs. Granted, I am still learning Google Docs. It has a lot of cool features. And I know I can save a Google document as a ms word document, which is great. But it honestly feels like all this extra hassle. I save it as a word document, and then google docs can't open it for me to edit it, so I have to open the Google Docs version and then resave it, and agh.
4) No caps-lock key. So yelling in an email is much more difficult, hehe:-)

That's all I can think of for now. I highly recommend this for someone that needs it for emails, note-taking, internet use, etc. And even for a student, with a few minor tweaks, it works well. I've been happy with it, so much so, that I'd like to become more acquainted with Google Docs, etc. and keep a chromebook for my main laptop. Having the MS Word application on my laptop is something I really miss, HOWEVER, I do not miss having a buggy and slow computer, that's so much more terrible than having to take a few extra steps to save a document. And note taking on this thing in class is a breeze. There are also tons of useful apps in the Chrome Web Store. So many of which I have yet to learn about and use. One of my friends recently saw mine and bought one for her son, who's 5. It's easy for him to use. Great for all ages. Overall, I highly recommend this chromebook and think you'd be very happy with it. It certainly can't be beat for the price and functionality.

Being in school, I require my computer to be good at a little bit of everything. Streaming was particularly important to me, I mean, netflix and chill, right? I had asked around for a long time about their opinions on the Chromebook line, and the Chrome OS, granted most were die-hard Mac and Windows users, but most bashed the line, so I took my search to the interweb.

After a day of in-depth, and heavy usage, and a night of standby, my battery is still at 72%. The overall experience of this machine and its OS scream productivity, multitasking, and scholastic.

Just as everyone else I noticed the CPU staying at 100% right out of the box which makes it impossible to do anything! I did not even bother uninstalling any Lenovo related software because the laptop was simply unresponsive because it was “busy” doing something else. I’ve had 12800 4GB stick lying around, so I pop it in, format the C drive and install my own Windows 7 Pro x64 and it did not change a thing… The machine without any software kept on staying at 65-80% load on the CPU which makes no sense to me. I believe the CPU has a flaw in it and hence they are getting rid of this junk for that cheap. Besides, the windows I installed off my USB drive (which is known to work well and activate with multiple legit license keys) failed to activate with the license key Lenovo came with. I called Microsoft and they told me that Lenovo has blocked the key for any further activation… Then, I called Lenovo Customer Support and after being transferred a couple of times AND having to repeat myself EVERY time, the last representative told me they are lacking in proper training to help me fix the problem. Besides, they were like: “You should not install anything on this laptop besides what the laptop came with”. I LOL’ed.

Conclusion: nothing against Lenovo, even though I don’t think they know what they are talking about, DO NOT buy this laptop, would it be for your grandma or aunt – JUST DO NOT BUY IT… There’s nothing you can do to take the load off the CPU unless you install Windows 95 on it LOL. It’s going back to where it came from.

B00TB8L0B0,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,24 September 2015,the United States,False,"Let me try to be fair on both sides.

Pros:
1. This is a <$300 laptop, that is NOT a cloud-based one or a tablet. Meaning, it actually has a SATA hard drive rather than a ~20GB flash memory and a full desktop OS. If you search for laptops around this price range, most found laptops required streaming service because their flash memory is too small to store any practically sized files.
2. Also within this price range a lot of the non-cloud laptops have processors worse than an AMD E1, believe me. To be fair for $200+, an low-end AMD processor is about what you can get without compromising too much on other aspects of the laptop.
3. 15 inch screen, although only supports half HD (720p)

Cons:
1. It is slow, by all standards. I am not arguing against that statement. Yet with some optimization and a little bit of patience it is not unusable.
2. Made with plastic shell. I understand to cut the cost down some compromising is required but, personally, I cannot withstand the plastic feeling when I first pull it out of the box.
3. Graphic card sucks. But hey, the seller made it clear that it has a on-board low-end graphic card.

In general, this laptop is the best in its class if: 1. you have a limited budget (<$300), 2. cannot take a laptop that always requires good internet connection to use (chrome book, cloud book, etc.), 3. want a decent sized screen, and most importantly, 4. have some patience, know the physical limitations of the hardware and would only use it for casual use (not 3D gaming, not full HD streaming, and not data calculating).
Otherwise, consider something else.

B00T0QZL40,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,14 March 2015,the United States,False,"I am very happy with this laptop. First of all, if you do not know what a Chromebook is, make sure you understand that before buying one. I'll try to explain it a little at the end of the review.

I upgraded to this Chromebook from the 11"" C720: Acer C720 Chromebook (11.6-Inch, 2GB) (which is an excellent device by the way, I just needed a bigger screen). I initially went to the 13"" Acer Chromebook: Acer Chromebook 13 CB5-311-T7NN (13.3-inch HD, NVIDIA Tegra K1, 2GB) and I was so unhappy with that one that I ended up returning it (screen was dull, performance was slow, case felt flimsy, and battery life was bad).

I am very happy that Amazon has this 15"" Acer Chromebook now, because it is exactly the size I wanted, and it so far, feels like a great computer. Compared to the 13"" which felt like it was going to crack if you picked it up by a corner, this 15"" laptop feels sturdy, and although 1.5 lbs. heavier (at just under 5 lbs.) you are able to lift if with one hand by the corner of the laptop without it flexing much.

I wanted the version with the full HD screen (C910-C37P): Acer Chromebook 15 C910-C37P (15.6-inch Full HD IPS, Intel® Celeron, 4GB, 32GB SSD) but there was a 1 - 3 month back order delay for shipping from Amazon, so I decided to go with this version instead. I am very happy with the screen so far. Although it isn't super sharp and bright, it is brighter than the 13"" Acer Chromebook, and displays videos well. However, if you plan on using this outside under bright sun, you will might have a difficult time seeing the screen, even at the highest brightness setting.

The speakers sound pretty loud for personal use. I like that they are on the front of the computer next to the keyboard, so the sound is less likely to be obscured by the laptop casing. The touch pad is fairly responsive. The computer performance is adequate for regular web browsing.

This is my first Chromebook upgrade to 4GB of RAM, and I don't think I noticed too much of a difference between the 2GB of the C720. However, the important stuff works well, and I am currently running with approximately 20 open web tabs (mainly news stories from various sites) and although there is a slight lag when I right-click on a link to open a new site in a new tab, it is handling the load pretty well (and I have had as many as 45 tabs open without too much lag!)

Battery life: I'll update if anything changes, but so far the battery life appears to be on par with what I expected. I have been using the laptop during this current session for exactly 2 hours, with the screen brightness at 100%, and browsing the web and checking emails. Starting from a full charge, I still have 74% of battery left, and it estimates 5 hours and 11 minutes are left. So based on that, and on my prior use of the laptop, if you had your screen fairly dim and had the WiFi off (which is impractical unless you are just typing a document offline) I could theoretically see the battery life making it to the rated 9 hours (or more). Otherwise, I think 6-8 hours of battery life can be expected with normal use.

I've noticed a humming noise recently, it sounds like a fan. I was under the impression that Chromebooks were fan-less (at least the prior two that I owned were). However, it is so slight that I only noticed it coming on and off very late one night while using this computer (when my entire home was completely silent). I don't really hear it during the day when there is any other noise in the area.

Overall impression: This is THE Chromebook that I was waiting for. It is perfect for most computing needs. I still love the C720 for its compact size, excellent battery life, and because it is so lightweight, but for working and extended reading/emails/browsing, this 15"" laptop is the way to go. I highly recommend this Chromebook (or the more expensive full HD version if you prefer the better screen).

What is a Chromebook?
If you do not know what a Chromebook is, or have never used one, be sure to understand it before you buy one. It is not like a regular Windows or Apple computer that you may be used to. The entire computer is based on the Google Chrome web browser. Pretty much everything you do, will occur within the Chrome web browser. So you cannot install programs (like Microsoft Word, or games which come on a CD). However, there are ways to ""work around"" to accomplish most things that you need. Google Docs has a word processor that is compatible with Microsoft Word documents. The Google App Store has many add-ins and Apps for the Chrome browser that extend the things you can do with a Chromebook (like adding apps to your smartphone). Also, if you are tech savvy enough, the Remote Desktop App for Chrome conveniently allows you to connect to any other of your computers with a Chrome browser installed (and with Remote Desktop sharing enabled). That allows you to access a Windows computer, should you ever have the need while away from home.

You cannot currently use Skype on a Chromebook, but you have Google Hangouts, which works very well for video conferencing. You will not be able to install Microsoft's Outlook for email, but you can access Outlook.com on the web. Likewise, you will not be able to install Internet Explorer or any other web browsers, but you have Chrome web browser. Anything that you can do on an Internet web browser, you will be able to do with this Chromebook. The main things that people do can all be done with this laptop: checking email, reading websites, going on Facebook, watching YouTube videos, etc... (However, it does not have a CD/DVD drive, so you cannot rent a movie DVD and watch it on this, but you can rent and stream movies from Amazon Video, Hulu, Netflix, etc).

You can manage files to an extent by inserting a USB flash drive or a memory card, so you can transfer and view picture files, but it is slightly different than on a Windows laptop, and since this Chromebook is based on the Google Cloud, it has limited storage space which is meant to be ""temporary"" so anything that you save to the computer's memory, could be deleted automatically when more space is needed by the system.

Overall, this is a very nice, low cost laptop, and I highly recommend it. Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments, and I will try to answer them.

B00T0QZL40,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,17 August 2015,the United States,False,"Know what you're buying.

I bought this for my parents after their previous computer finally died. Their previous computer was an older one of mine with Linux Mint installed. I showed them how to use it, and their usage requirements were pretty minimal: internet, word processing, Google Earth. I figured this would be an ideal replacement since they also were thinking of getting a laptop to travel with. And I figured that if they didn't take to Chrome OS I could also put Linux on it and have them back in familiar territory. Admittedly, I did not research this much before purchasing -- a quick Google search showed its possible to install Linux, but I did not get into the details before hand.

First, their requirements in a computer: Internet, Google Earth, Word (or Google Docs or Open Office). My requirements in their computer: Easy to use, reliable, minimum disruption to routine.

Obviously, Chromebook has internet covered. This is basically Google Chrome, it is the internet. But, I figured it would also have some built-in support for running some local programs; namely Google Earth. The fact that it seems the only way to use Google Earth with a Google Chromebook is to stream the application from a remote server that may or may not be always available or free is ridiculous. I wish I would have discovered that before, as this is actually a pretty significant loss of use for my parents. And, of course, since you can't install local software you can't really install Open Office either. But, I figured Google Docs would work well enough for them since word processing isn't something they do all the time; but only occasionally. My mother didn't really take to Google Docs, even though it was pretty similar to Word. But, even if she could adjust, there's another significant issue with Chrome OS that I didn't realize before hand. NO PRINTER DRIVERS!

Ok, you have to use Google Cloud print. That is also ridiculous. The main selling point of this computer over a standard laptop you can install Linux on is the price point. But, if you have to replace all your previous equipment just to have things work the way they should that point begins to loose some serious weight.

So, I was able to satisfy some of their requirements, not all. And I knew the Chrome OS was going to be reliable. But, to satisfy their requirements I needed to install Crouton. I chose Crouton because of the lower impact to the system and small amount of space required (this only has 16GB). There's two things to keep in mind when installing something like Crouton. 1) You have to keep the Chromebook in developer mode; this creates an arbitrary 30 second delay on boot. Not to mention it looks scary to someone who isn't really familiar with the terminology. 2) To get into Linux its a little bit difficult. Open Chrome, ctrl+alt+t to get to crosh, type shell, then type sudo startxfce4. I made this process a little easier by bookmarking the crosh page and calling it ""Start here for Linux"", and setup an alias for Linux and have them written instructions to follow. But, it is still disruptive to their routine.

For now this is their setup, I know I am going to have to make some future changes and streamline things as much as I can. But, I also live 4 hours away from my parents so it's going to be a bit of a drawn out process. My first step for sustained maintainability is to get remote desktop working -- I installed it in the Chrome OS, but couldn't quite get it working before I had to leave last time.

PS: I used the faceted search feature of Amazon to filter out features that I knew I wanted. I selected touch screen as one of those featured I needed, because I wanted to try to get them used to using it for a smart phone or tablet. Though this laptop showed up as a result of that search, this is definitely not a touch screen laptop.

I'm still trying to make this a good choice for my parents, but right now it is not the best choice for them. I hope this review helps anyone considering the same. If it's just internet, it's perfect. Otherwise, know it's limitations.

B00T0QZL40,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,10 November 2016,the United States,False,"Great chromebook! I was originally looking for a chromebook because I liked the idea of a simple, elegant, but power computer for college. Turns out it is all that.
This chromebook is VERY fast for a computer like this. Very snappy and quick to load everything. As advertized, boot-up time is insanely quick. Most of the time I can get it to start up to get to the login screen in 2-3 seconds flat. Very fast.
Great for using google docs/slides/excel, also youtube, spotify, and almost anything you could want. You can also have a lot of tabs open and still not experience a slow down.
BATTERY LIFE: Battery life is so great, no joke. It is so good that you do not even need to power off the computer when you are not using it, just close the lid and it will go to sleep mode. Doing this will make it last more than all day, and depending on how much you use it maybe more than all day.

Obviously chromebooks cannot get as many applications as windows and mac users, but when buying a chromebook you have to realize that fact and then it is not even a problem. I personally also have a windows PC so I am good for when I ever need to use one.

Printing is a bit of a hassle because I was never able to get it to print via a USB connection, it always has to be via wifi it seems. So if that works for you, then you are good. This is another thing that you will have to understand before buying.

Another thing I want to mention because it is awesome: The speakers on this thing are...wonderful. They can be so loud if you want it loud and will remain to sound very good. I was using spotify a few minutes ago and I could blast Fall Out Boys to completely fill my dorm room to the point where it was kind of obnoxious. Very cool.

The camera on the computer is fine but not spectacular, but what do you expect from $300 chromebook? Just fine for skype and video chats.

Screen is nice but will look weird from different angles which is expected from the type of screen it is.

That is all I have to say! It is great and I hope it lasts me a long time. Had it for about 2 and half months now.

Its lightweight and small for the amount of power (specwise at least), this laptop is supposed to have, and I like Windows 10. I know Windows 10 can annoy some, but I always was a windows guy (anyway this is not a review of windows).

The bad: The wifi is terrible. This is a Corei7 with 8gb of ram and a fast SSD, and everything crawls if you need the internet, which I do all the time. I then started to wonder if something else was wrong, since scrolling stuttered and some things paused before executing. I turned off Intel Speedstep and that helped to speed things up, but wifi still sucked if it was more than 20 feet from an AP.
The display is grainy and this is the infinity display, which is supposed to be gorgeous. Well it was alright until I put a Retina MacBook Pro next to it and then it looked abysmal. So sad. I really wanted to love this laptop.

Battery is ok, 5.5 hours...which seemed ok until I started using a Retina MacBook Pro, which was lasting 7-9 hours. The dell loses a decent amount of battery even in sleep, while the mac doesn't lose anything.

I guess I am getting a MacBook pro which is sad because it is heavier, bigger, and it runs Mac OSX.

Oh well, no matter anyway you spin it, this Dell XPS is ok until you realize there is a better option for the same price.

B00P8OMIDK,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,19 March 2016,the United States,False,"I'm no where near a laptop guru but I am one happy customer so far. I needed an update in a laptop since my CCFL was going out in the old one. I decided to try and go for Asus since they have treated me well in the past with electronics. I had it ready and setup out of the box in under 10 minutes, that surprised me but nice nonetheless. I didn't purchase any of the upgrades that other buyers have done so this is a purely out of the box review.

Speed - The speed of this laptop can vary, it sometimes opens pages really fast and other times kind of slow. I need to remove bloatware and that should help it speed up. But so far this laptop has surpassed my expectations and it's a definite improvement to my Acer. If you only want a laptop for some web browsing/Skype with some light gaming this is perfect for the price.

Screen - The screen is a very nice size, it makes the webcam show more of the room which was different for me but not too bad. You can change the brightness to what ever you want but I really like that it dims when not in use then shuts off, like my tablet from Asus.

Keyboard - It's very roomy and soft to press, there is a number pad so some of the keys are moved to the left so it took me a second to adjust.

Touch pad - This is the only real problem I had with this laptop, it has some major annoying features that it took me a while to figure out how to stop. There is a pinch zoom feature that becomes very annoying if you accidentally hit it with 2 fingers like I do or drag your finger. I figured out you can stop most of with the ASUS Smart Gesture program and that definitely salvaged my experience. Since turning off some of the touch pad features, it is a major improvement for my experience using it.

Games - I downloaded Minecraft to try and it logged in no problems. I didn't have to adjust anything or turn down graphics. The world was loading up a bit slow but it wasn't problematic for me. I forgot to check the FPS since I was showing my mom some things at the time. Also to my surprise it plays WoW on low low graphics and quite well to my delight. I haven't installed my addons at all but it was running pretty good at 11-28 FPS depending on where you are in the game, I had slight delay when I attacked but no where near as bad as my old desktop. I originally bought this laptop for web browsing and Skype so it's pretty awesome I can play some of my favorite games on the go. I am sure it could play a lot more games but these are the only 2 I really tried.

Webcam/Microphone - I tested Skype right after I got it set up with my boyfriend and from what he said the camera is pretty good and the mic sounds clear and loud. My tests seem to give the same results. So this laptop is perfect for Skype if you are in a Long Distance Relationship like myself.

B00P8OMIDK,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,2 January 2015,the United States,False,"QUICK SUMMARY: Nicely-featured, low-end laptop will suit many user needs in a very affordable price-point. Several quibbles keep me from loving it, though.

BACKGROUND: I bought this laptop for my wife, who uses it for email, Netflix (DVD and streaming), creating documents, and surfing the web. She plays no games and uses few other programs besides the Microsoft Office suite. It replaces a 10-year-old Dell laptop running Windows 7 Professional on 1GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD. Her old laptop was choking on lack of RAM.

OUT OF BOX EXPERIENCE: This Asus had relatively little bloatware, but there are a few Asus utilities and Asus-selected apps from the Microsoft Store preloaded. I was surprised and irritated that Asus included Windows 8, not Windows 8.1, which meant I spent HOURS downloading security patches and doing the Windows 8.1 upgrade followed by more security patching. But the *worst* decision Asus made was pre-loading McAfee anti-virus software tools. The McAfee scanner gobbled up 500MB of RAM memory on a machine that only had 4GB to start with! This, without me asking McAfee to do anything on my behalf. My experience with McAfee and Symantec's Norton anti-virus products is dismal and it's impossible to fully remove their fingerprints from a system (running their uninstaller program notwithstanding).

FOR TECHIE FOLKS ONLY: I also encountered an error when I tried using my Windows Home Server 2011 to backup this Asus laptop. The problem is that this Asus uses GUID Partition Table (GPT) for disk partitioning rather than Master Boot Record (MBR). There is a hotfix for WHS 2011 for this, but that has it's own issues, so I've opted to use Windows 8's new backup/restore methods, like using File History. I still created a system image backup in Windows 8, though, just to have an image copy of the hard drive. To rid myself of McAfee and Asus's utilities, after I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and learned I couldn't use it with my WHS 2011 to do nightly backups, I decided to do a fresh install of Windows 8.1, deleting all of Asus' hidden restore partitions (which would have uselessly restored my laptop to Windows 8 and caused me hours of subsequent patching, rather than restoring this laptop to Windows 8.1) and letting the Windows 8.1 installer program create all the necessary partitions beyond the C: partition that I created myself.

PERFORMANCE:

- About 45 seconds from power-on button to sign-on screen
- About 1 minute, 15 seconds from power-on button to your Desktop after signing on; this was actually 30 seconds faster than our old laptop that had an SSD but only 1GB of RAM!
- Using the USB 3.0 port, I moved a 70GB file averaging just under 90MB/second
- Using the USB 2.0 port, I moved a large file averaging around 25MB/second
- The wifi card was moving about 4MB/second between our home server and this Asus laptop

WHAT I LIKE:

- Fairly lightweight, weighing just under 5 pounds (nearly 2 pounds lighter than our 10yo laptop)
- The built-in CD/DVD drive is great for my wife, who still handles physical media to play movies from Netflix and the library
- Has both VGA and HDMI outputs
- Has a USB 3.0 port, which was helpful in quickly moving some large files to this laptop
- The color display looks nice, as long as you're looking at it straight-on and not from a side angle
- This is my first Windows 8 machine in the house (besides my college-aged son's laptop), but using freeware Classic Shell makes this laptop look and act like our familiar Windows 7 machine
- Fairly standard 4GB of RAM and 500GB HDD is a big step-up if you're using an old laptop or desktop

WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:

- The keyboard is terrible, but my son says that most keyboards today are terrible, so this one is no different than all the other terrible keyboards out there, especially for a low-cost laptop like this one. It's a chiclet-style keyboard, and typing on it feels pretty awful, really.
- Already mentioned above, but this laptop comes with Windows 8, not Windows 8.1, meaning you'll spend hours to patch/update your operating system, and you'll do it again if you do a factory reset sometime in the future
- The WiFi doesn't operate on the 5Ghz band, just the heavily-used 2.4Ghz band
- There is no disk activity light! I really dislike not being able to tell if the disk is doing anything or not, especially when I want to perform some operation (like hard reset my laptop) and need to know if my laptop is actually doing something, and isn't stalled
- The battery life isn't any better than laptops made new 10 years ago; expect ~2 hours
- The touchpad isn't as sensitive as I'd like, and there appears no way to adjust the touchpad sensitivity, either. I found myself having to tap the touchpad (for a left-mouse click) repeatedly because my first tap didn't register. I downloaded the latest touchpad driver from Asus, but that didn't help any.

CONCLUSION: This isn't the cheapest low-end laptop on the market, but what you get for the extra hundred bucks you're spending on this laptop is probably a little faster CPU, the built-in CD/DVD drive, a single USB 3.0 port, and perhaps a slightly larger hard disk. I primarily got this model for the built-in CD/DVD drive. Windows 8.1 works well on it (using Classic Shell so it looks like Windows 7), but getting from Windows 8 to 8.1 is all up to you to do. To me, this is a 3.5 star product (rounded up to 4-stars, as I like it in spite of my quibbles).

I have a computer guru friend who set it up for me and for me it is very user friendly. I use it for e mail and shopping---both features work wonderfully. The only thing I can say against it is that it is a windows 8. Which no longer receives updates. But as far as I am concerned, great computer. And, most importantly, it goes with my decor.",0
B00P8OMIDK,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,24 July 2015,the United States,False,"While light weight, sleek, and elegant on the outside, this is a wretched performer. It's biggest problem is that you cannot turn off the touch and tap function on the mouse pad. When you are typing, the slightest brush of a finger across the pad will cause your cursor to jump if you are in the middle of a word processing document or an email, you can lose large chunks of text. Of course, you can hit Function-F9 -- but that disables the mouse completely and you can't move the arrow. Whoever at Asus thought up this idea needs to be fired!
In addition, either the Asus or the Windows 8.1 operating system is the worst since the last bad one. Google Chrome is constantly shutting down due to some sort of conflict between Chrome/8.1/Asus -- this has been going on for over a year and no one seems able to fix it.
Asus is not good at handling multiple windows. If you want to check a word processing document while working on line, you can click on the Word processing icon (I use Word) and then pick the document you want to look at. It takes up to 30 seconds to load, and then when you go to start editing it, or even just moving down a page, the whole thing freezes up and you get the dreaded ""Not Responding"" message -- I have never had a computer from Acer, Dell, Gateway, or IBM that freezes up as much as this computer.
In Windows 8.1 -- the interface between the traditional program icon menu and the blue Apps menu is annoying for those of us used to the traditional program menu which works just fine -- and probably would be much faster if it didn't have the App program trying to run as well -- and if you brush the mousepad in the right place, it toggles between whatever you are doing and the Blue App menu -- incredibly annoying, time consuming, and inefficient. Asus's opening window says something about innovation and inspiration -- nothing about this computer seems to indicate that either of those qualities was involved in its design. Buy something else -- not this!

The keyboard has a nice touch and the numeric pad is a definite plus for me (lots of data entry!). Another plus is the non-reflective screen, a great relief after my old Dell which did not have one and was a pain to adjust for internal light reflection and almost impossible to use outside.

Two slight niggles are the absence of flashing LED to show Hard Drive activity (although the screen ""twirler"" seems to indicate this, it is not so clear) and the lack of HDMI port. Although there is a ""Thunderbolt"" port, it will need a separate adaptor to run to the HDMI port of my external HD screen. Having said that, the definition, contrast and colour balance on the laptop screen are excellent.

I'd say this may be one of the best bangs for your buck. You get a lot of stuff packed in here for a reasonable price.

I did find 2 downsides though: 1st, the track-pad straight up sucks. I'm not going to lie. If you use the track-pad a lot it will not be your friend. It does not register my finger very well; I have to glide my finger across it just right. But It's not really a problem for me because I use a wireless mouse anyway. If you use a mouse you'll be fine!!

problem #2: The speakers don't play very loud at all. Very very quiet. Gets muffled when you turn it up. But again, it's not that much of a problem for me, because I don't use audio very much. (I'm a visual effects guy anyway), and when I do watch Netflix or something on it, I use speakers or headphones anyway, so there's that.

I can live with the downsides, so it's kind of the perfect laptop for me!

B00OJHHYOA,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,4 August 2015,the United States,False,"I have found this computer to be extremely frustrating. I have always had Lenovo laptops, but this seems to be the worst one I've ever had. I have had this computer for a little over 3 months. After 1 month the computer completely shut down and wouldn't turn on. I had to bring it it to be serviced. The technician said that the inside of the computer needed to be cleaned which struck me as odd as it had only been used a month and at a clean desk. The cleaning fixed the problem. He also noticed the wi-fi cable was lose and he fixed that.

Since day one the computer freezes about 2-5 times every day. I have to do a Control + alt + delete to unfreeze it. It's really annoying. As of last week the mouse stopped working properly at random times. I have to re-boot the computer to get the mouse to work. At other times the mouse is so sensitive that it sometimes clicks on random things when I'm not even touching the keyboard.

The battery lasts only 3 hours, even when I am only using one open excel spreadsheet.

Load times on everything are super slow. I've had a couple of colleagues jump on my computer while we were brainstorming and doing a project together and everyone ends up saying ""I hate your computer!""

The computer shuts down randomly without warning to do updates and doesn't reload your web pages - it doesn't seem to store the memory of the sites. It's very frustrating.

That being said, I will say the graphics on the computer are very nice, so if you're a movie watcher or doing anything with design, it does have a crystal clear picture. They got that right. But one thing that is unfortunate is that the way the screen was engineered - it's size and function means that it rubs up against the keyboards very closely so every time you close and re-open your computer, you can see all the keyboard keys on the screen. There just wasn't enough space between the screen and the keyboard when the computer is closed. There is a border around the keyboard that sticks up and it is putting a permanent line on my screen that won't scrub off with anything. So the graphics are difficult to enjoy with this permanent line going through the center of my screen.

Every day I put my computer inside a very cushy, padded case, but even so, the brushed steel on the outside of the laptop seems to get scratched all over. I have no idea how that happened. So after 3 months of use, the computer looks banged up and used.

I wish I hadn't purchased this computer. I have only had great experiences with Lenovo, but I feel like I've gone back in time in terms of usability, technology, and design. Unfortunately Amazon only allows a 30 day window for returns. So I'm going to be doing battle with the mouse and the computer freezing randomly throughout each day. It's a bad customer experience.

B00O0L06OK,Ninad Chitre,5.0,Worth every penny,31 October 2016,the United Kingdom,False,"Hi Guys,

I bought this lappie in mid Nov 2014 for about £240. Have been using it for about two years. While purchasing, I confirmed with an Amazon Sales Advisor that it had an optical drive. But I found none on the machine. Got a refund of about £40. (But the whole process dragged on for months)

For a £200 laptop I am absolutely delighted to have this one. In a few days windows 8 was updated to win 8.1. While on win 8.1 I used, reused and abused the os but my loyal lappie never deserted me. It worked so well that I kept postponing the upgrade to win 10.

Despite a duel core celeron, it allowed me to run not one but TWO virtual machines AT THE SAME TIME! Can you imagine doing this on a mere £200 laptop? Did the 8 gb ram did the trick? Well, I can only guess. The processor is the quickest part of the machine. The overall response speed depends on much slower auxilliary circuits. I must give full marks to HP for managing the processing power. That's somethiing I really appreciate.

Microsoft forced me to upgraded to win 10. That's another horror story. But after a few setbacks the new os is settling in. And yes, the VirtualBox can still run 2 vms at the same time!

Here is a glilmpse of the things this lappie has done for me.

1. Watchig hd video : Absolutely no problem. If needed , just close other apps.

2. Streaming avi, mp4 out of the box to smart tv over wifi : Never had any problem. The transmission is ultra smooth. Used samsung allshare.

3. USB ports : The usb3 port is really very high speed. Fills up my 64gb usb3 flash drive in a few minutes. The usb2 ports are also working well.

4. Storing movies, songs, photoes : 1 TB is more than enough for all my media needs.

5. Run VirtualBox virtual machines : Virtual machines are resource hoggers. This lappie manages them so well. I am tempted to buy an HP Desktop with heavy processing power to run all my virtual machines.

6. Last but not the least - Booting over virtual hard disks (VHDs) : This machine took some time to adapt to the new booting conditions. It ran a lilttle slower. But that's expected. The intel celeron 2840 supports hardware virtualisation technology. What a bonus.

In the end I am a happy man. I got an all singing all dancing model. ;-)

B00O0L06OK,NGMOTO,1.0,Send us all a free optical drive to compensate please!,19 December 2014,the United Kingdom,False,"I have been looking for a laptop of this spec for my wifes Christmas present for quite some time now and was about to purchase a new Acer with the same spec for £229. 00 then this so called Flash sale popped up on amazon with this Compaq that had ticked off all the boxes on my list with the exact spec the she required from as new laptop, so you can imagine my disappointment when her laptop turned up today to find that it is not as described as it does not have the optical DVD drive as advertised and she needs for her work (not to watch movies)!
Its now too late to send this back and find another lap top as the deal that i have seen for the Acer with the correct spec and within my budget has now sold out. So as a long term Amazon customer that spends thousands of pounds each year with your company How about sending me a satellite optical DVD drive as compensation that she can plug into a usb port then everyone will be happy!

I Upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 7 (and I do mean upgraded!)
Very Nice Laptop, I chose for decent price, i7 processor, great battery, and the fact Acer has all the drivers for windows 7 i could wipe that win8 garbage off the laptop. This laptop is compatible with SanDisk SSD's you just need to turn off the UEFI boot if you will be going back to windows 7.
Couple Minor issues
--------------------------------------
1) touch pad is huge: my palm had the habit of hitting the pad and clicking so turned that off, also I accidentally misplace my click fingers right and left out of habit with smaller pads and incorrectly left or right click some times.

2) touch pad is huge: Also after turning the mouse speed up all the way, it still seems to take alot more effort/finger movement to get across the screen than i am use to. (man that sounds so lazy when written down....)

3) My SSD (480gb Sandisk Ultra II ) came from a previous laptop (worked perfectly) Cleaned and Fresh install (latest bios update), very intermittently (every 8th time or so) from Power off startup will say no boot device. hit Ctrl-alt-del it will reboot and take off just fine. I believe the SSD is taking longer to power up than the laptop is willing to wait. Acer says they have not certified SSD's in this laptop so your problem if you put one in. (I told them they were stupid for not testing every laptop with an ssd of some kind.)

4) Ensure of the correct touch pad and wireless driver. I installed the wrong wireless/bluetooth it kind of worked but not, uninstall and worked great. Installed the wrong touchpad driver worked but occasionally touchpad would just lockup/not respond. reinstalled correct problem disappeared

5) No CD/DVD this is the norm now especially for low power use laptops but it does suck to be in town and have to pull out a portable CD and try to find a surface to put this thing hanging off your laptop somewhere , or worse yet forget the DVD drive at home.

6) WIFI and Indicator lights. Two of my biggest gripes are to adequately control wifi and blue tooth you must use the secondary application (LM radioController) Acer created to turn them off and on. There are NO LEDs for hard drive activity, or WiFI so you have NO clue what is going on with them. It sounds stupid but..surprising enough the missing leds are alot more of an irritation for me than I would have imagined. It has only two leds, mostly redundant. A battery status led and a power plugged in led. surprised they did not combine them into a single like other laptops I have had...

Great things:
------------------------------------
1) Phenomenal battery life (with SSD) in power save mode wifi and moderate use. I have actually gotten about 7 hours check it was telling me 1.5+ plus more. I have not yet actually run it out in one sitting yet.
2) Pretty quick system Compiling in Android studio and Visual Studio very decent. Not quite as responsive as my 8 core PC when doing multiple tasks but it is a laptop. Video card decent, It's not a full on gaming system but very acceptable. Looking at passmark it is only 4th generation but slugs it out with some of the 5th generation cpus that seem to mainly be improved in power consumption more so than performance.
3) Lighter than other average laptops. As powerful as it is seems alot more light weight than my works thinkpad and my old gateway. A good sign was my wife said that my laptop was so light her next one needed to be more like that.

I would give it 5 stars if: Acer wakes up and sees the trend of SSD's being installed and starts supporting them. no Wifi or Hard drive led. Touchpad was not so huge. And although the laptop has space and a port built in to accept a internal DVD drive they refuse to discuss, or offer an option to install one.

Pro:
can go up to 2.4 speed.

Ram can go up to 8 ram

Really easy to use.

Video quality Is good when watching netflix or other videos

It's light so it's easy to carry around.

The price is really good for this kind of laptop.

You can upgrade a lot of stuff onyour laptop such as more ram battery and so on.

Cons:

When you first buy this laptop it only comes with
1.8 of ram so you can only bring up one page at a time fast it's pretty fast but if you try to pull up more than one page it's really slow.

The battery life isn't very long especially if you put your laptop on bright so you might have to buy a longer battery life.

Over all is a nice laptop. The only reason I rate this is because this ram is kind of small when you first buy the laptop so expect to do some upgrades on it otherwise is a good laptop.

the keyboard has been malfunctioning since i bought it, and most of the time the spacebar doesn’t work.

also, it sounds like a jumbo jet taking off. the fan is insanely loud, and often randomly starts when on sleep mode, and with no way to turn it off you just have to wait for a full minute or so of incessant whirring, humming and buzzing.

one last wonderful thing about it; it’s made of very cheap plastic which bends and cracks simply in your bag. half the screws holding it together have fallen out so now the battery sometimes falls out, the screen comes undone or the casing cones apart.

there are much better laptops out there at this price point and this isn’t worth your money whatsoever.",0

Quick note the laptop is smaller than it appears on the amazon cover photo, but I have found that it is the perfect size for me, not too big nor too small.

Windows 10 is now installed and it works well.
It is still a little slow after the initial boot up because the hard drive is working at 100% however there is plenty of processing power and memory available. I am considering upgrading to a SSHD but in truth I am wondering if it is worthwhile because, as long as I am patient for the first 5 minutes after booting it is fine.
I have used it for large databases, presentations with a lot of graphics, HD Netflix and Amazon Prime movies and it works well. I don't do gaming so can't comment on this aspect.
The full size HDMI and SVGA connectors means that you do not have to carry around a bunch of adapters if you want to use other display medium.
I originally rated this with 3 stars but now find that I am getting used to the touchscreen I find it a quite capable machine. Although the battery life could be better.

ORIGINAL REVIEW
First things first, it comes with Windows 8 that can be upgraded to Windows 8.1; you just have to be patient.
Boot it up, connect to the internet and do an update. On my machine it had 156 updates the first time around, 27 the second time around and 8 the third time. You have to install all of the updates BEFORE you can upgrade to Windows 8.1 for free. THIS ALL TAKES TIME, do be patient.
It comes with a whole load of preinstalled bloatware; it is up to you if you want to keep it but it does slow the computer down especially the MacAfee 30 day antivirus, I removed it but this has to be your choice, there are many free antivirus programs that can be downloaded.
If you prefer the old Desktop mode, as I do, Windows 8.1 allows you to boot straight into it. Once again the internet does tell you how to do this.
The screen does not fold all the way back, it cannot be used in tablet form but as I mainly use it in the Desktop mode and very rarely use the touch screen and the associated Apps this is not a problem for me. However, if any of you are looking for a touch screen computer and don't mid reaching over the keyboard this does it at a reasonable price.
For an Intel i7 with 8GB RAM it is a slow machine, I would have expected something faster but this might be down to the Hard Drive as opposed to the processor (update, this is certainly the case).
It connects easily to my home network (well Windows 8.1 would wouldn't it) and all-in-all it is an adequate laptop. The battery lasts just short of 3 hours but then with such a large laptop who would want to balance it on their lap for longer, if not on your lap then when on a desk you can plug in the mains. While on the subject of the mains supply, it does not give any indication that it has power until you look at the little LED when connected to the Laptop (maybe I have been spoilt using higher end machines).
The large keyboard has a number pad, another reason I selected this laptop.
It boots up from OFF (not sleep) in 22 seconds and from sleep in about 3 seconds, but cannot use it for high powered applications for a few more minutes due to Windows checking drives etc.
The Bluetooth connects easily to my headphone/mic and the speech recognition works well, without too much lag.
The touchpad requires some getting used too but I gave up and bought a wireless trackball mouse.
Because it is not a quick i7 (even with the bloatware removed), less than 3 hours battery life and other minor niggles it is an OK laptop hence I gave it an OK 3 stars. I certainly don't love this laptop, it difficult to even ""like"" it. But it does the job so it is OK, if I could give it 3.5 stars I would but it is not quite worth 4.
It is a basic Windows 8.1 computer and if that is what you are after go for it.

B00HR88W9Y,Stuart Foot,1.0,Absolute JUNK,22 July 2015,the United Kingdom,False,"Purchased the model with the i7 processor thinking it would be relatively fast an efficient.

This awful laptop is anything but. Glacially slow and stuttery, and prone to freezing, even using everyday software like iTunes and Football Manager 2015 (on pretty modest graphics settings necessitated by the pitiful capabilities of the computer). The screen is prone to randomly reducing in brightness before correcting itself again when it feels like it, and unless you're sat in at least semi-darkness, the caps lock light etc. are effectively useless.

An astonishing poor product given its decent spec on the face of it, and absolutely infuriating to use.

B00HR88W9Y,mike bloxham,4.0,"Had some setup problems but after solving issues this a high quality mid-range laptop, very happy with purchase.",1 May 2015,the United Kingdom,False,"I have been using this machine for a couple of weeks now and so far I'm very happy with it indeed, although there has been a few fairly tricky issues.After unboxing and firing up the machine I had real problems getting connected to my home network via Wi-Fi. It just wouldn't connect. Tried all the usual things. Disconnected all other devices, reset router etc. but just couldn't get on wireless. After a lot of googling and tinkering I managed to diagnose the issue.
It turned out that the default power settings on the wireless adapter were set to disable it when the computer is in power save mode. After changing the power settings (right-click on the battery icon on taskbar, go into power settings, get into advanced power settings,find wireless adaptor,set to maximum performance) it connected okay, but was still dodgy and kept dropping out.
I connected it up to my router via ethernet cable and downloaded a bunch of Windows Updates and after a day or so Asus sent an update out via the built in Asus Update software which sends updates to the machine over the web. It was an updated Wireless driver, so I installed that and it seemed to fix the problem for good. Hopefully.
After the initial problems, I found the laptop to be really nice to use. It's a pretty decent solid build that feels fairly sturdy,the textured finish on the chassis is nice (although a bit hard to buff the fingerprints off) . Display is nice, clear, sharp, bright and the touchscreen works perfectly. Good marks for sound quality as well, a nice full sound and goes really loud! Very good for music and video. The smart gesture touchpad is a little hard to get used to but once you get the hang of it, it's very useful.
I'd advise getting the Windows 8.1 update as soon as possible to improve the interface. As for performance I must say I was expecting a little bit more from the i7 processor. It's very fast, but you still get hangs every now and then and I was expecting boot speed to be lightning fast. I think a solid state hard drive would improve performance quite significantly and I plan to upgrade the HDD at some point to make the most of the i7 chip.
Overall, i'm very happy with this laptop, I had some problems getting everything working but it's all fine now and I'm really enjoying using it.

Many companies have gone for a buttonless touchpad to mimic apple. However PCs don't work well with a buttonless touchpad simply because the pc mouse has two buttons. So they write software drivers to recognise whether you click on the imaginary left or right side of the pad. This never works well and it's horribly frustrating to the point where I start banging the right side of the pad with rage trying to get the bloody right-click to work. It is sooo silly to make such a good quality laptop and have it let down by such a silly design error. What's wrong with good old left and right buttons hey? It got so bad I started looking for a new laptop. Unfortunately almost everybody seems to have gone for this design and I suspect they all use the same buggy touchpad drivers.

B00H522400,R King,4.0,Mostly awesome,18 October 2014,the United Kingdom,False,"Purchased this laptop to replace my ageing Toshiba Satellite Pro. Very happy with most aspects, but a couple of annoyances.

First the good stuff. This is very obviously a professionals machine. It's sturdy and very solid with a great keyboard that offers very clear tactile feedback. The keys don't feel cramped and it's possible to type quickly and accurately.
The screen is excellent. It's very bright and clear and displays colours clearly. Battery life is excellent. I routinely run may laptop off battery for four or five hours between charges, and it also appears to charge very quickly when connected to the mains. The mains connector is rectangular and similar in format to USB, and is very satisfying to use. Again, this gives a feel of solidity and robustness.

Performance is excellent. I selected this device because I wanted to use Ubuntu as my primary OS, and it works really well. I've been tempted to replace the spinning HDD with an SSD, but not sure how much benefit I would see.

Now the bad. This laptop doesn't have an HDMI connector. I was so sure that it would when I purchased it that I never even checked. As most laptops, and even desktop PCs, have this as standard it seems like a major omission. This is not a small device and there's plenty of room for an HDMI socket. I'd certainly have been happy to loose one of the four USB sockets for this.

My biggest annoyance by far with this laptop is the touchpad. Lenovo have copied the Apple 'rocking' mechanism which sees the whole pad respond to a hard press. It's far too easy to inadvertently do multi-touch and move the cursor unexpectedly on the screen. It's also hard to right-click unless you press the pad right in the bottom corner. A simple flat pad with two buttons would have been much easier and more satisfying to use. I've persevered with the pad, expecting that at some point I would see the benefits, but a month into using this device I still dislike it.

B00H5147U6,Jenny J,3.0,Good after a few tweaks,5 August 2014,the United Kingdom,False,"Nice lightweight laptop. I have had it for several weeks and use it regularly but have some slight irritations about it. My main reason for giving 3 instead of 4 is the unnecessary programs that came pre installed, as these seemed to give me problems connecting to wifi:

1. I know people complain about Windows 8, but I figured I'd be fine as I'm usually pretty good with technology. I was mistaken, as Windows 8 is really annoying if you are not using a touch screen device. I downloaded some apps to get rid of the Windows 8 start screen and the annoying 'swipe' commands, so it works more like Windows 7.

2. I had a BIG problem connecting to Wifi and it took me a long time to work out why. I was able to connect either at home or at work, but not both. The problem was solved by UNINSTALLING McAfee and several other 'bloatware' items. The McAfee on my machine was only licensed for 6 months. Just install AVG free instead.

3. The small screen is nice, though I have had some problems with apps not fitting/readjusting to the small screen size, so some of the buttons or functions (e.g. in Handbrake) are difficult or impossible to use unless you plug in to a larger monitor.

4. Sound quality is poor, but that's to be expected really. I always use earphones or plug in to external speakers and this works fine.

I downloaded Apachce Open Office so I could write word documents and spreadsheets. I also downloaded VLC as the video playing software on the laptop told me it needed updating on first use, which was just annoying (I just won't use it, as VLC does everything that I need).

I also bought a Samsung external DVD drive (less than £20) to go with my laptop. I only take it when I need it, so I think the lack of DVD drive but decrease in weight is a good compromise.

I'm still a way off customising my laptop to how I would like it, but for the money it is a nice, small, portable laptop for working on and can easily be plugged in with a screen, mouse, speakers and external DVD drive for optimal use.

This is some £600 pounds cheaper, much more substantial, a little heavier but meets all the requirements we have. Its a dinky thing, the keyboard is a little small, but we wanted a light weight, small computer and that's what we have.
The 13 inch screen is large enough for photo editing, its good for word processing (and why shouldn't it be) and fulfills all the functions required of it and then some. All in all one of my better buys.",0

It is small and reasonably light with all the connection you could ask for. The HDMI output is perfect and works well streaming to my TV. I use an external HDD full of films and this plays it very well.
You get a free upgrade to windows 8.1, which isn't really all that different form Windows 8. It does take a lot of getting used to but it still isn't as good as Windows 7.
The only downside I have experienced is the touchpad. It can stick sometimes andthe buttons are integrated into it so if you want to left click, it can slide the pointer off the button. I would buy a wireless mouse though.
Battery life is good and can even play decent 3D games without much effort. Not tried the most modern ones though.

After upping the memory to 8GB, which isn't absolutely necessary, this little gem fair whistles along. OK, the storage might not be huge, but more than enough for everyday use. The battery is OK around 5 hours on high performance and once you get used to the keyboard, you're sorted. I only mention the keyboard as it took a little time to get used to hitting them a little harder than my old Toshiba netbook. The space bar is a little sticky sometimes if you catch it on the edge, as opposed to the centre, but like most things, once you get used to it, it's fine.
I would seriously recommend anyone wanting to upgrade their netbook or simply getting a smaller less expensive laptop, this one is a serious contender. I'd even say this one gives the bigger laptops a run for their money. Especially if you're on a budget.
I'm so pleased that I got this one. It does everything I want it to do and more.

I finally decided that I want what I want and I want a Thinkpad! Awesome decision. This is a spectacular workhorse. Includes DVD drive which is becoming increasingly rare these days but is extremely convenient when you want to load music or software programs. So the DVD drive adds a touch more weight (my office Thinkpad is around 1 lb) it's worth it.

PROS - battery life, durability, display, Windows 7 OS (Win 8 sucks), processing speed, etc.

CONS - Win 7 OS. I miss the lightening speed of powering up the Chromebook. When will MSFT solve the problem?! Hate the Windows updates that unannounced take several minutes when powering off and then AGAIN when powering on. Last con is form factor. It's a black brick.

B00GQATWW0,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,1 June 2016,the United States,False,"UPDATE:

This laptop is now 4 years old, and still running stong. I'm running Windows 10 now, and I've upgraded the RAM, and switched from a HDD to a SSD. It's been running everyday, for about 12 to 18 hours daily - sometimes more, rarely less. No gaming, but plenty of heavy work such as MATLAB, COMSOL etc. The only issue that has come up, which is honestly to be expected, is the battery, which now gives about 2 hours worth of use (that's what the system approximates anyway).

Original Review:

I've had this laptop for about a year and a half now, and I have used it everyday since I bought it.

I have never had any issues related to software or hardware; everything is still working as it should.
For $650, the laptop had a 500 GB HDD, 4 GB RAM, 1366 x 768 14.0"" matte display and Intel Integrated Graphics (I would really recommend trying to get a higher resolution screen). It came with Windows 7 Professional, and I upgraded that Windows 10 Pro. I do find that the laptop, and programs were slightly faster with Win7 as the OS, though.

Ports include: VGA (D-Sub); Microphone/headphone combo; Mini DisplayPort; 2 x USB 3.0; 2 x USB 2.0 (including one specially designed for fast charging); SD card reader.

The only hardware modifications I've made are adding an 8 GB stick of RAM for a total of 12 GB (out of a maximum of 16 GB), and swapping out the CD drive for an HDD caddy, and putting a Samsung 840 EVO SSD there. That SSD stores my main programs and OS. The original HDD stores everything else. Getting access to the components is really easy; just remove 2 screws on the bottom, and the cover slides right off. Immediate access to HDD, 2 RAM slots and wireless card.

Just browsing the internet alone, I manage to get about 5 - 6 hours. That range is dependent on what exactly I'm doing on the internet (watching YouTube videos drain the battery faster than just reading web pages). If the CD drive is under constant use, expect less battery life. Having only the SSD in the laptop, while not using the CD drive can lengthen battery life (SSD uses less power than HDD).

So, on to everything I don't like about this laptop.
1) For a 14.0"" laptop, it's noticeably and significantly heavy (almost 5 lbs) and bulky (over an inch thick). (-0.5 star)
2) No wireless AC; only wireless-N. A wireless AC card can be purchased, however, and installed with ease.
3) No hardware switches for toggling wireless; this must be done while the laptop is on, and using Fn + F8. Additionally, No indication lights for things such as hard drive activity, or battery status/charging status. (-0.5 star).

Things other people may not like:
4) Keyboard: Function keys are integrated with multimedia keys. Default operation is multimedia. For example: To decrease or increase the volume, you press the F2 or F3 keys respectively. To activate the functions of F2 or F3 however, you need to press the function button (Fn) THEN press F2 or F3. You can also press Fn + Esc to 'lock' the Fn button, so that you only need to press F2 or F3 to get the functions of F2 or F3.
5) Touchpad: Many persons are not fans of the integrated design, where the buttons and trackpad are integrated into one. I have no problems with it.

B00GQATWW0,Anonyme,1.0,Sans titre,17 April 2016,the United States,False,"I'm disappointed with this computer and will be replacing it as soon as possible. I specifically wanted a computer with a back-lit keyboard, and the specs said this one was. It's not. And apparently that's just the way it is - it doesn't come with a back-lit keyboard. So I bought another keyboard and replaced the one that came with the computer. Now I have a keyboard that isn't back-lit and has only one functional Control key.

Weird things happen with this computer. Sometimes the cursor inexplicably jumps from the insertion point to someplace else in the document. Sometimes it doesn't save. I tried to rip CDs to the drive; it doesn't play some of them. I get alerts all the time that my C drive (444 GB is out of memory), but I have only documents on the computer - no movies, no pictures, no games.

Used this laptop for a week now (Jun 21st 2014) and noticed one major issue with it. The TouchPad starts jumping the cursor to right corner every time I take my finger off. Its Synaptics touch pad and the issue could be with Win 8.1 drivers (Laptop comes with Win 8.0 that upgraded to 8.1 for free).

Other than that this V5 573p 9899 has everything going for it and thus deserves 5 stars.

Edited: 6/30/2014.
Jumping cursor issue kind of getting resolved by itself, not sure why. I updated the Bluetooth/wifi drivers from Acers support page for Windows 8.1 and haven't seen the issue again. Its beyond me how the BT/Wifi drivers would fix synaptics touchpad issue.

I really like the bright full HD screen, great 4 speaker sound and a good processor/ram combination.

I installed VMWare workstation to run Win 7 on the laptop and it is fast. In exclusive mode I can literally forget if Win 7 is running in VMWare or native. Processor is fast and laptop has virtualization on by default.

I have not experienced any issues with the Wifi range as some other reviewers.

In my opinion, this laptop is well worth the money. Just be aware if after buying, you feel issues with trackpad, just update all the drivers (and I mean all the drivers) from Acer's official download page after upgrading to Win 8.1.

A recommended product.

B00GK6GIM2,Anonyme,2.0,Sans titre,1 February 2014,the United States,False,"Overall this is a nice laptop for the money. The screen is big and bright and I'm surprised at how well the touch screen works. It works nicely with Windows 8. Just upgraded to 8.1 with no issues.

Some minor quibbles: it's a shame they put the Core i7 with the 5400 rpm hard drive. Clearly that's the limiting component. I was thinking that I would replace it with an SSD, but I've since read that on these models it is somewhat challenging (not impossible) to replace the drive. You might want to research that further if this is your plan. I was also somewhat disappointed with Acer's specs on this unit which claim that it has a VGA port, but it doesn't. I need to use a variety of projectors and some only have VGA. Minor workaround is to get an adapter, but they shouldn't claim VGA if it isn't there.

I'm reasonably happy with the purchase considering the price point.

Update one year later - wifi has become an issue. No change on our part, but won't connect reliably anymore and the speed is very low. I've read a bit that indicates there is a wire from the motherboard to the antenna in the screen that may break and it seems that may have happened to us. Works fine when connected to a wired LAN port. Rather than muck with the wire, I'm going to try an external USB wifi connection. Some others (not everyone) seem to have issues with wifi, so be warned about this unit.

B00GK6GIM2,Anonyme,3.0,Sans titre,31 July 2015,the United States,False,"Unit purchased in April, 2014. In the interest of full disclosure, until April of this year, I would have rated it 4 1/2 stars.
The Good:
G1 - no problems, whatsoever, with the laptop's ability to run, stand-alone, any app I've installed, including Office Pro.
G2 - it came without a lot of proprietary ""enhancements"". There ARE parts of the OS that the Windows helpline guys won't touch, due to OEM customization.
G3 - upgrade to Windows 8.1 was painless.
G4. operator input mechanisms: touchscreen implementation is great. I love the freedom to move between the touch pad, keyboard, touchscreen, and mouse at will. I'll never go back.
G5 - the display is VERY clear and sharp.

The Bad
B1 - Poor design choice of OS. Laptop came, loaded with Windows 64-bit, which I thought would really be great because it would utilize the entire bus, etc Wrong. Researched the diff between Windows 32- and 64-bit, I learned that Windows DID NOT RECOMMEND USING THE 64-BIT OS. The OS is NOT optimized for 64-bit machines. It's optimized for huge databases. Why is that Acer's bad, rather than MicroSoft's? Acer should have gone with the recommended OS.
B2 - Capabilities and upgrades for 64 always lag those for 32. Customer base is significantly smaller, so release dates and software functionality & reliability are lower priority.

The Ugly.
Ug1 - The display crapped out. On 21 April 2015, the display began to feature a 2-inch-plus band of solid black from top to bottom of the otherwise-beautiful display. ALL of the time. Apparent quality problem with connectors to the 2nd bank of LEDs.
Ug2 - The keyboard sensitivity seems to be off. When using the keyboard, there seem to be almost-randomly-repeated characters when a key is struck only once. Could be that the sampling rate is too high.
Ug3 - The plastic above one display hinge has a 2-inch crack from one edge of the display back to the other.
Ug4 - Too (two) few horses under the hood (pun intended). The i7-4500U (whose ""integrated"" architecture is a dual-core CPU with a graphics chip mounted on the motherboard--no graphics card) chokes, most notably when running multiple graphics-intensive apps simultaneously, e.g., when running the browser with multiple tabs/sites open, or when manipulating high-res images. I've gone from an 8-year-old quad-processor with a separate graphics card (with its own video card with dedicated GPU and dedicated graphics memory, in immediate proximity) to only two processors with a heavier-than-ever load to handle, ALONG WITH the necessity to share a significant portion of the system DDR3 to execute the graphics functions. Because the memory (and, BTW, processor time) is dynamically allocated between open applications and concurrent graphics processing, not only is less memory available to each concurrently executing process, the computer also has to do more context-swapping than it would otherwise. I read that the CPU actually employs part of its DDR3 L as cache memory. The fact that it does should raise a flag. It might well be part of the reason the first memory bank is soldered in. My 8-year-old Dell laptop actually renders HD images faster than my newer Acer. When I select a high-res image to view, I get to wait and watch while the computer renders it, line by line. SO, if you buy this laptop, you might want to plan on maxing out the DDR3 L. Even then, you might have the occasional crash when concurrently running Powerpoint, a browser, and an image editor or another similarly taxing load.

B00GK6GIM2,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,22 February 2014,the United States,False,"I ordered this laptop from an Amazon Marketplace Seller and it arrived very quickly, in about 4 days. I had also ordered a Crucial 120 GB mSata SSD drive on the same day. Unfortunately, the mSata drive took 10 days to arrive so when I received this laptop, all I did was just turn it on and made sure it worked.

Once the mSata SSD drive arrived, it was time to reformat the laptop and do a fresh install of Windows 8 on the mSata SSD drive. Since this laptop didn't have a SSD drive, the most economical option for performance boost is to buy a mSata SSD drive and use it as the boot drive for the operating system. Then use the Sata drive that came with the laptop for data storage, which in this case is a nice 750 GB capacity.

Installing the mSata drive was quite easy. I turned the laptop over, unscrewed the 20 screws, and removed the bottom panel to expose the full motherboard. Then I just seated the mSata SSD drive into the mSata slot and screwed it onto the board. After that, I removed the 750 GB Sata HDD drive and just set it to the side. I went into the BIOS to make sure the laptop saw the mSata drive, which it did. Then I proceeded to install a fresh Windows 8 ISO onto the mSata drive by booting up the laptop through my USB stick and running the installation. After that, the laptop was running purely on a mSata drive with no Sata drive in it. I then reformatted the Sata HDD drive and put it back into the laptop to be used for data storage.

In inspecting the motherboard, there is one RAM slot that is upgradeable and contains a AData 2 GB stick of RAM. The other RAM slot has RAM soldered onto the board. I plan to upgrade the memory from the current 6GB to 12GB by replacing the 2GB stick with a 8GB stick. Hopefully, there won't be any issues with running a 4GB RAM stick with a 8GB stick, i.e. RAM with mismatched sizes.

Now onto the actual useability and performance:
Pros:
- The 1920x1080 HD IPS screen is beautiful. Very vivid colors and very bright.
- Nice ""looking"" back-lit keyboard with numeric keypad. More on the keyboard later
- Performance is fast and rock solid. The speed may be due to the SSD that I installed as I don't know how it performed out of the box. Running PcMark 8 ""home conventional test"" which involves browsing and light gaming received a score of 2388 which didn't seem too impressive although this score was rated as 29% better than the average score for an ultrabook, which was 2179.
- WIFI is actually very good. Good range and no connection drops as reported by some people. Maybe the Atheros WIFI driver got its issues fixed.
- Temperature - stays cool. Never felt any heat on the palm rests while using it for hours.
- Battery life - I'm on the fence about this one. Right now, I can get a max of about 4 hours and 45 mins with not too heavy of use - surfing the web and doing some Java coding. It's still better than my Samsung Series 5 NP530U4C-A01US laptop which usually got around 3 hours 45 mins. I was hoping this laptop would get 6-7 hours. I'm hoping the battery life will improve after a couple of full discharges of the battery. I had a Acer Timeline X a few years back and noticed that the battery got better after a few months use.
- Pretty good speakers even though I find laptop speakers generally useless

Cons:
- Weight - this isn't a big drawback, it's just not super light for an ""ultrabook"". It weighs around 4.8 lbs, which is ok for a 15.6"" laptop. It's also not super thin like the Samsung Series 9 books.
- The keyboard is very average. It just doesn't have a soft, precise feel that I like. The travel is very shallow due to the ""ultrabook"" design. Typing is pretty accurate once you get used to it.
- The track pad is too sensitive. I find myself highlighting and accidentally dragging things when moving the cursor around. The off-center placement of the track pad is actually ok since it still aligns underneath the center keys of the keyboard. I thought it would be a pain or something that I needed to get used to.
- The right side fan can get loud at times when doing cpu intensive tasks such as video editing. Normal use, it's ok. I generally don't hear the fan while working because I listen to music with headphones.
- No VGA out. There's a proprietary Acer converter port that has different dongles such as VGA, LAN. The laptop did not come with any dongles, so I couldn't use the VGA input on my home monitor. I ended up having to buy an HDMI-to-DVI cable from Monoprice to use the monitor.

All in all, I'd say this laptop has excellent value. There is no other laptop that you can get with a I7 Haswell chip and 1920x1080 resolution for less than $1500. This one only cost me around $725 and another $80 for the mSata SSD upgrade, which makes it a great buy in my opinion.

But I have returned it because of its abysmal sound quality, I can get more and better sounds from any of my tablets or smart phones. I don't know whether the sound card is not up to the job and/or because the speakers are located virtually under the base unit. In any event I could not recommend anyone invest in a comparatively expensive device which you have to bend forward to hear properly.

Unfortunately, I can't - yet.

I am a huge fan of Asus products. I am looking at my Asus monitor right now while I write this review, using my Asus motherboard (probably my 10th Asus mobo by now), and I have many other Asus products.

Before I go any further, I want to express my gratitude and pleasure dealing with Asus' 24/7 Technical Support phone line. Asus is providing the level of one-on-one service that used to be the standard for all great tech companies. Unfortunately for consumers, this is now an extremely rare level of service. BIG kudos (and +1 star) to Asus for this!

The K550-EH51T was a present for my wife. We have been using it for about 2 weeks now.

Overall, this should have been a decent laptop PC. The screen is good, and the PC is fairly responsive for a Core i5 processor. I absolutely detest the Windows 8 O/S, but that is mostly fixable through free apps (like ""Classic Shell"") that give you back a full Windows 7 user interface.

O/S issues aside, we have had two significant problems with our K550-EH51T:

1) The touchpad has been acting erratically, where the cursor ""quivers"" and jumps randomly when using the touchpad. The cursor is almost impossible to control with the touchpad when this happens. I called Asus tech support on this, and they had me uninstall the touchpad driver (without deleting the drivers from the hard drive) and reboot the PC to have the drivers automatically detected and reinstalled. This has worked - for now - but I can't say that I believe it to be a solid solution. Fortunately, we don't need to use the touchpad much, so this wasn't a deal-killer for us.

2) The installed WiFi adapter is constantly having issues. It is slow to make connection to websites. And, it randomly ""forgets"" the connection to my WiFi router. Sometimes, the WiFi adapter doesn't even show that there are any WiFi adapters available in the area, even though there are about a dozen. *THIS* is a deal-killer.

I have tried resetting the PC to factory defaults (for that fresh, out-of-the-box feeling) a few times now. I have not been able to fix the WiFi problems yet.

At this point, the laptop has (a) sporadic hardware problems; and/or (b) driver problems.

I am making one last-ditch effort to reinstall Win 8.1, and associated drivers. Maybe this last time will fix everything.

If not, I will return this laptop to Amazon, and replace it with the same model.

Stay tuned ... I will update this review with my progress.

********************************************

2014-JAN-10:

Reinstalling Win 8.1/drivers did not work. Sending laptop back to Amazon for a replacement. I will let you know how Asus laptop #2 works out.

********************************************

2014-JAN-14:

The replacement laptop arrived from Amazon. WiFi is failing in exactly the same ways. There must be a driver or hardware issue with the Qualcomm Atheros chipset (Other manufacturers are having similar issues with this chipset). I will be returning this Asus laptop, and purchasing something else.

Bummer.

B00F0LEA1Y,Stephen C.,1.0,Everything slow from boot up to internet connection. Review May 2016.,29 May 2016,the United Kingdom,False,"The worst laptop I have ever had. Came with Windows 8.1 and was awful. Finally Windows 10 was available and vastly better. However I thought I had poor internet provider, web running slow or not responding. After buying an iPad I realised nothing wrong with my connection, the laptop just sticks all the time. Even Word now can take 5 minutes before I can start working on a document. I regularly have to take battery out to turn off and re-start when it will not boot up. Makes an old HP with Windows Millenium look good. Agree with previous buyer, will never buy Toshiba again. Bought laptop from an independent retailer locally, another mistake. They had not got a clue and loaded it with rubbish freeware and took a week to get it running after it choked up. Cleared it all out and used AVG and much better. However 2 1/2 years later it is almost unusable. Will save everything on to hard drive and go to Apple next. Have used Ethernet cable for months and it is still slow. Worst in the morning when I really need to do 5 minutes word processing and get off to work. Could have bought a lower spec model by anyone else and had less trouble.",0

B00DW2IR1W,John Walton,1.0,Poor laptop with huge motherboard problems.,21 April 2015,the United Kingdom,False,"I am sad to have to give this product a 1 star rating because on paper, this laptop is great. I work for a school and we purchased 40 of these laptops of which 14 ended up having to be returned to the manufacturer due to mother boad failures. Even after having their mother boards replaced, 2 had to be sent back again for exactly the same problem. Perhaps we had a bad batch, but Lenovo claim they have no reported problem with other customers with the same model. We have made no changes to the setup and are using the genuine supplied chargers that came with them but they seem to drop like flies with no warning.

The ones that work are great, but now that the warrantys have expired, the remaining laptops are slowly developing the same issue. We are a site with over 300 Lenovo laptops and it is strange that this E531 is so problematic.

I have to touch on the positive and they are that the display is great, very crisp and the audio quality of the internal speakers is great for a laptop of this price. When working, boot speed is impressive and the i3 processor is certainly impressive in a laptop of this cost.

The touch pad is terrible, not comfortable at all. My advice is to avoid this laptop at all costs, at least until Lenovo admit there is a core fault with their motherboards. I would never buy one of these myself as I would want mine to last at least a couple of years and the way ours are going, I think the chances are slim.

B00DW2IR1W,Charlieboy,4.0,You might like this,31 December 2013,the United Kingdom,False,"If you want a mid range laptop, but with a non-reflective matte screen, this could be the one. Screen is only a standard 1366x768 though.
Comes with Win 7 preloaded and in the recovery partition and Win 8 on a DVD if you want to move onwards (not necessarily an upgrade?!).
It's got a nice keyboard and works well for an i3 processor. If you are used to older Thinkpad trackpads and Trackpoint buttons, this takes a bit of getting used to with the pad buttons combined. But after a while it's fine.
Fingerprint reader software update stops it working, so don't accept that update just now. There's a thread on Lenovo forum that tells you how to fix if you do so.
Some bloatware software that you can uninstall, but overall this PC is good. Better than most at same size and price range.",10
B00DPES0R8,NormanJackson,5.0,Fantastic laptop/tablet!,30 March 2014,the United Kingdom,False,"I love everything about this laptop - the yoga multi-mode design is genuinely useful, and I find myself flipping between conventional laptop to tablet to stand to suit whatever I am doing (haven't found much use for tent mode yet though).

The good:
i3 processor is fine for everything I have thrown at it so far
HD videos play smoothly
Speed with SSD is great - Windows 8 and applications load in no time.
Keyboard is excellent - there is very little travel with the keys, which combined with their responsiveness means that my typing speed has significantly improved.
Screen is bright, sharp with good contrast (blacks do look black). Is a bit reflective but bright enough for this to not cause a problem. Brightness auto adjusts to suit ambient lighting & this is very effective
Touchscreen works well.
SD card slot is full depth!
Speakers are OK - sound is clear & volume usable in most situations
Size & weight are great - easy to cart around and rubberised surface is good to grip
Fan is very quiet - not really noticeable even when going full speed, which doesn't happen very often.
Temperature is good - never gets too warm to keep on lap or hold.
Construction is solid - rubber coating will scratch though, so best to keep in a soft case when travelling
Battery life is good - generally only have to charge it overnight and can then use through day without external power
Trackpad is the best I have used - very responsive & two finger scrolling is great

The not quite so good:
Trackpad buttons are sometimes a bit fiddly
Most bloatware is a waste of space so has been removed (why do all PC manufacturers insist on installing anti-virus software trials when Windows 8 has Defender built in?)
Upgrading to Windows 8.1 wasn't straightforward - I needed to go to Lenovo's site to download new drivers for everything before power management started working properly
No network port, but I use with wifi 99.9% of the time so it very rarely causes an issue

Bottom line:
I love it! Thank you Lenovo!

B00DPES0R8,Undermanager,3.0,A good laptop but not perfect,16 January 2014,the United Kingdom,False,"I needed a portable and light laptop and the Yoga 11S with an i3 processor fitted the bill. I bought the orange one, and it looked great, although the extra £80 compare to the identical silver one is a lot just for a colour! The machine boots up very quickly, in less than 10 seconds (Google Chromebooks should be worried, as this is their major selling point). It's quiet, has a perfect keyboard and screen and feels like quality. The touchpad is excellent and there are enough ports. Although 128GB hard drives are advertised, you actually get about 70GB, the rest being consumed by Windows and the incredible amount of bloatware Lenovo ship the laptop with. Get the bigger 256 GB one if you have the option and money. The different positions for the screen and keyboard are nice and have some uses but it's too big and heavy to be a tablet to be held in one hand. As a laptop, it's good. The battery seems to be around 6 hours for general surfing and watching a few YouTube videos. The touch screen is very responsive and really helps using the laptop. I didn't realise that Chrome on the Yoga 11S didn't seem to pinch and zoom so had had to go back to Explorer. That brought its own problems; I had to spent more time trying to get rid of Lenovo's Explorer settings - not easy! Then there are issues with Explorer, which kept crashing when browsing in laptop mode and when you are in laptop mode but convert it to tablet mode, Explorer also froze.

You can get a free update to Windows 8.1 but it took me an *entire day* to do: research upgrading a Yoga 11S first and take note of the excellent advice on updating (1 hour), update Windows 8 drivers first (3 hours), download and install Windows 8.1 (3 hours), download and install the extra drivers (1 hour), fault find why audio didn't work and try lots of solutions (4 hours), remove Lenovo's bloatware, (2 hours), investigate why Explorer kept crashing (not solved).

UPDATE: I would not buy this machine again. It's too much hassle and too many things make it an unpleasant experience. I wanted a laptop I could turn on and use, not one where I would have to spend many hours setting up and even then, had problems with crashing. It has been returned to Amazon. I think with hindsight I should have got a machine with Windows 8.1 installed and properly proven. Before you buy this machine, go to Lenovo's own support forum (Google it) and read about it from people who have bought it. That way, you can make an informed decision.

I agree it is a good price for a good spec machine. However please note the following poor design fault. There are only two USB slots on this machine both on the left hand side. If you have a dongle (I have one from 3) the design and spacing of the USB slots means you can use only one slot when using the dongle and therefore the other slot becomes useless/redundant. This means if you want to use a USB mouse with the dongle you can't, nor can you quickly put in a USB memory stick without having to disconnect the dongle on every occasion. This is a poor design fault that could have easily been avoided. I know what you will say get a USB adaptor that you plug in and expands you options in relation to USB's but this is not easy on the train plane etc. I am surprised by the fault from Toshiba, but if I had know about this I would not have bought the laptop on this point as it renders it a one slot USB machine which is useless for my requirements.

B005FW9SPQ,Mr. S. Fish,2.0,Returned,12 July 2012,the United Kingdom,False,Mine was making a unusual sound from possibly the hard drive? It was returned for a refund. A great shock as it was an Asus!,0
B005FW9SPQ,Mr Jay,4.0,Lovely little netbook but better battery would be a benefit,29 January 2012,the United Kingdom,False,"At the price being charged by Amazon (at the time of writing), I have to say that this is a very impressive netbook for the money. You will struggle to buy anything cheaper. I wasn't expecting too much at this price with regards to overall quality, but found there's little to complain about.

My first impression was very positive. It's a really cute little machine (and really nicely packaged too). For the money, build quality is absolutely satisfactory. I was impressed. Solid and well put together. No annoying gaps or creaks. Not too keen on the glossy plastic bits around the screen and keyboard, but the textured finish elsewhere looks nice and durable. It's smart and stylish.

The chiclet keyboard is good quality and feels suprisingly nice to type on. The trackpad is also totally fine and very pleasant to use.

Performance wise, I found it absolutely satisfactory too. Starts and shuts down fast and it's perfect for a light user (internet browsing, e-mail, etc.). The first time I've used an Atom processor and I would be totally happpy with how the N570 performed. It's also a very, very quiet machine.

However, as others have pointed out, this particular model comes with a three cell, 4.5 hour (max) battery and that will probably translate to between 2 and 3 hours at the most for general use. A bit of a shame, especially as netbooks like this are so light and portable that you don't want to be tied to a socket. Of course, you can always get a six cell battery (from as little as £30 on eBay but not genuine Asus ones at that price) later if you need more battery life.

I also thought when plugging it in to the mains that that the (tiny) power connector seems quite flimsy and I would be concerned with its durability. But that is a concern shared with Asus netbooks in general, not just this model - it seems that about all current Asus netbooks have this tiny, mobile phone sized connector and socket. It's about the only thing I didn't like.

So, overall, a delightful, little computer for the money. Exceeded my expectations (I was just after something cheap and basic to handle light internet, e-mail, Skype duties). And while tablets may be the in thing these days, I have to say that 'the netbook' is a lovely concept and really nice to use.

I would happily buy again (as long as the power connector doesn't one day confirm my suspicions of its flimsiness...). But, in hindsight, I would have paid the extra few tenners to get a different Asus model (either this or the very similar 1015PX) with a bigger and better six cell battery.

Needed something smaller than the regular 15.6"" models, but with plenty of oomph to run GIS, image processing, big complex spreadsheet models, edit huge reports etc. Received quickly, under stated delivery (less than 48 hours from order) and all seems to be good. My 3 stars come because system was older than I expected. I understand used, but there is used and well-used, and this falls into the later category. The only date I could find was on the battery pack, which gave 2012, so the system is 4 years old. As notified, there was an external scratch, nothing to worry about. More serious, on the keyboard around the touch stick, the letters G, V, B all had some yucky deposit or visible wear. Came as advertised with Windows 7 professional which I updated to Win 10 professional for compatibility with my other systems, no problem with that. Also came as promised with 500 GB HD as promised, 4 GB RAM etc. I have yet to use it seriously on the road, so we will see how the performance is, but I think it will be OK for what I need - a portable machine with good performance, not too big, at a price I won't cry over if it gets nicked, driven over or etc. Would I buy again?

B004YJOJLY,powellfan,4.0,Nice - but no T Series thinkpad.,8 March 2016,the United Kingdom,False,"I don't normally purchase HP products, after a bad problem I had with one of their printers. I much prefer the T series ThinkPad. but this elitebook 8460p was a good price for a second laptop just for running M$ Windoze. the build quality on this elite book is excellent. it is very sturdy and obviously built with business in mind. The unit I received from marketplace seller was in terrific condition. The model I received, had a slightly lower spec processor. I ordered i5 2540m 2.60GHz - but actually received i5 2520m 2.5GHz. the rest of the specs were as listed. this CPU still scores in excess 3550 in cpu passmark Not bad for an older machine. this laptop has USB 3.0 ports, FireWire, USB 2.0 Ports, DVD writer, modem, card slot (express card) and a few other ports not mentioned. The only omission appears to be the lack of a HDMI or display port. my model arrived with a radeon graphics card outputting at 1600x900 rather than the stock 1366 x 768. so that was a nice bonus. the keyboard isn't great, as I am not fan of the island style keys and silly layout of the arrow keys may prove to be a problem in the future. The stick pointing device is okay but not as responsive as the red nipple on the T series ThinkPads. I don't use the touch pad very often however this appears to be the only way to scroll down without using the keys, as there is no scroll button near the pointing device – just left and right mouse click.Ihave taken out the 4gb Ram, replaced it with 16 GB (two sticks of 8GB) that was on sale at crucial for less than 60 quid. I have also replaced the hard drive with an SSD that was a good price here on Amazon a few weeks ago. This Isn't that bad machine for 199. After I factor in the upgrades, (£60 for the RAM and £40 for the 240 gig SSD) then my total investment here is to £299. I know I could have got a cheap plastic laptop from one of the big chain stores such as Currys or PC World – but that we have only bought me a lower spec machine possibly an AMD processor and eight GB of RAM and a screen of lower quality. Overall, not a bad laptop and the seller was terrific. The seller packaged the product very well and they shipped quickly. If the seller has, in the future, any T series ThinkPads - then I would definitely order again.

B00440D5NG,Michael Brooks,2.0,Disappointing purchase,2 December 2010,the United Kingdom,False,"Laptop received in good time. Initially failed to boot-up on switching on.

Then shut-down machine, which subsequently failed to boot-up when later switched back on. Laptop returned to Amazon and awaiting their response.
From very brief experience of the laptop here are a few points:
Cannot open lid without holding machine down as hinge mechanism so stiff.
All inputs arranged on sides of laptop (power, USB's, etc.), also CD/DVD, which means lots of wires sprawling out from sides rather than back of machine and, if you use a mouse rather than the touchpad, the CD/DVD tray opens onto and collides with mouse-mat and mouse. Small poinbt, but irritating.
Very sparse leaflet dealing with first start-up procedure. Manuals on disc accessible only after set-up.

B00440D5NG,JohnnyBoy,5.0,Great notebook.,15 January 2011,the United Kingdom,False,"I don't normally write reviews as I forget after I've bought the product but I remembered on this occasion.

Currently have a Dell Latitude D410 which is now 5 years old. The battery is shot and the screen is 12"" which is not ideal these days. It's a cracking notebook still but is not fit for purpose now so time for an upgrade.

I considered a Dell this time around but having recently experienced someone else's Samsung RV<something> 15.6"" notebook, it seemed to be very good. I've been a die-hard Dell fan for a long time but for a number of reasons, I am now not quite so committed to the brand.

Samsung stuff in my experience has always been very good - I've been in IT since 1990.

Whilst the Samsung notebooks running the newer i3 / i5 processors are of a similar price to the equivalent Dell, this particular model uses an older CPU but is still a very capable CPU (if you want a CAD / video editing / game playing notebook - you should consider a gaming notebook instead and should not be looking at £500!) - but is at least £100 cheaper - depending on which newer Samsung you look at.

So far so good - notebook started first time, ran through the setup wizard and installed itself fine. This was the case with the model I mentioned above as well.

Fantastic screen, great keyboard (which is raised in the middle for easier typing) and a good overall look and feel to the product. Performance is very good, although Windows 7 is streets ahead of Vista in terms of performance and reliability, and XP looks and feels a bit old now.

Actually quite light for such a large notebook and silent until the internal fan kicks in - which is quiet still.

This model also has Windows 7 32 bit installed (again, Amazon should really change the product description!!!) but I bought this notebook knowing this from a previous reviewer.

However, this must now be the outgoing model and 32 bit should not put most people off. There is nothing 'wrong' with 32 bit and it will still happily serve for years to come. Depending on what the notebook is used for, the only thing that might 'affect' most people is the amount of memory 32 bit can address which is 3GB - but that is what this notebook has so not a problem. Microsoft will still support both versions with security patches in the final support phase (extended support) until the product support runs out entirely.

I've only had it a day and I wont be the main user of it - but first impressions are good and I'm glad I bought this over the newer Samsungs and Dells (for price reasons alone).

>>>>> If you choose this notebook or any other notebook or PC, ensure you look into the recovery solution / software which comes on with it (Dells, for example, have rescue media so this note isn't relevant). Once you have - be in a position where you have backed up the recovery 'image' if possible. This unit uses Samsung Recovery Solution 4 - which has the ability to write the rescue image to an external disk or DVD etc. Make sure you do this as if the hard disk fails completely, you potentially lose your rescue image and you will have no immediate way of rescuing it. You will then need to pay for either rescue discs from Samsung or try and get hold of them another way, or buy Windows 7 retail, or pay a shop to fix it - all for the sake of a few minutes of time. I've made two DVD copies of the image as hard disk failures can and do occur! <<<<<

B00440D5MW,Kate,4.0,Good but not great,20 March 2011,the United Kingdom,False,"I've had this for a month now. I'm very pleased with it's speed.
There wasn't too much pre-loaded software. I only had to delete a trial version of MS Office and the Virus Checker, neither of which I wanted. The Windows Live suite of programs were preloaded.
The start-up instructions for the laptop were minimal; I would have liked forewarning that the setup routine would ask me how I wanted the disk partitioned, ie how much space I wanted allocated to the C: and D: drives. I think I rushed this and probably picked the wrong division.
There are times when I wish I had bought a 15"" laptop but then I find myself pleased with how light and compact this laptop is, so the reduced screen size is an acceptable compromise. The high reflection on the screen is annoying, but then it is hard to find any laptop in this price range that does not have a glossy screen - unless you buy a Lenovo (maybe I should have bought one of those?).
I have now bought a 23"" Dell screen for use at my home desk and am very pleased with how the Samsung laptop works with this.
The restart from sleep mode is less than five seconds which I find very useful. The keyboard is responsive and seems robust.
I have not yet got the hang of the touchpad. The electronic Samsung User guide supplied with the laptop says that ""the gesture function is not supported"". I think this is incorrect, today I discovered by accident that you can get the screen to scroll by using stroking two fingers up or down. Also you can zoom-in and out with two finger pinching or spreading, just like the Ipod Touch gestures.

B00440D5MW,JH,4.0,"Good all-around, poor mouse, get 480M",10 March 2011,the United Kingdom,False,"Hey,

Bought my Samsung SF310 from Amazon a few weeks ago. On the whole I'm very happy with it. Two different versions are available, one with the 480M processor and the other 460M processor. I got the 480M for about ten pounds more by selecting the right top-level options on the amazon search, and processorbenchmark shows that this was a very good price given the improvement in performance.

The battery life is at least six hours for non-intensive applications such as reading and writing - if it appears reduced, see if the antivirus is scanning. The touchpad is quite non-standard. First, it's large, so you need to make larger motions to move the mouse across the screen. The mouse-buttons are integrated, so the technique of resting your thumb on the button and navigating with your fingertip doesn't work. You need to navigate, then lift your finger off, then tap the button you want to click. It's better after a few weeks of getting used to it - but it's still one of the worst touchpads I've used. This in contrast to the keyboard, which is one of the finest. If you're used to using keyboard shortcuts, or doing a lot of keyboard entry, then it's well worth going for this laptop.

Yours,

B003UV047U,S. J. Brown,4.0,"Great package, great value",18 December 2010,the United Kingdom,False,"Yes, it's a 'great package' but (as with any purchase) it has to be put into context. This is 'great' because of the price I paid. Maybe 'great value' would be a better description. It is very well specified and I'm sure most people will find it more than adequate for their purpose.

As for the specification, 2GB of RAM seems to be the de minimis these days (though it can be expanded) and the processor won't rip up trees but the rest of the spec is at the upper end of adequate.

The screen is nice and bright with good colour depth and Bluetooth, Draft-N wifi and a webcam (with face recognition log-in) are all very nice at this high-level of build quality and at this low price point.

Downsides? The sound is a bit weedy and I'm sure hardcore gamers would need a bit more 'oomph'.

Aside from those minor niggles, it's a damn good all rounder.

Is it as good as my new Dell XPS 15? No, it isn't. But it's not a million miles behind and the Dell was almost twice the price of this Lenovo!

B003UV047U,Matthew Crook,4.0,For a not-so-business consumer.,20 September 2012,the United Kingdom,False,"UPDATE: Piece of s***. Just after I published this review, the laptop stopped working altogether. Couldn't find the problem. I now have my own custom-built gaming PC. Never purchasing pre-built laptops/PCs again.

As an owner of this exact laptop model now for just over 2 years, I can safely say this laptop will meet all of the average consumer's daily needs. I thought it best to own this laptop for a while in order to deliver a fair, and detailed, review. The title says ""not-so-business"", and what I mean by that is that it this laptop is really designed for a person like me: I don't own a business, nor do I use the internet or applications for heavy-duty instances such as web design, editing software etc. I use my Lenovo G555 purely for time-wasting and fun, and it does a perfect job at it; Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google+, Wikipedia, checking my bank account, doing a bit of online shopping and going online to play some games on Newgrounds (who hasn't?)

So, the hardware. Let me start off with the keyboard. The buttons are laid out in the tried-and-true ""qwerty"" fashion and it works absolutely perfectly. As you'd expect. As I'm 21 years old, I have used ""qwerty"" styled keyboards since my Dad purchased Windows '95 back in 1996. I was young, very young, but I picked it up straight away and I've always found it easy to use. Same here, but you do of course get a few extra functions. You get a typical laptop button ""Fn"" which stands for ""Function"". This allows you to increase/decrease the brightness and volume and can also be used to switch the laptop into sleep mode, switch the output display to a different monitor (or even use both), play/pause music, and there is a ""ScrLk"", ""SysRq"", and ""Break"" function too. Number keys and their ""holding down shift"" counterparts are the same and so will be familiar to anyone who has used a qwerty keyboard before. Windows buttons are present too.

Now, one thing I did find is that dirt easily gets underneath these buttons and after a while, you'll find a random key starts getting stuck. Simple method: press the key multiple times, and hard, and the button should return to normal. Don't do what I did... take the button off, clean it, then realise the way they put the keys on the keyboard is almost impossible to replicate. So now I'm left with a keyboard with the ""J"" button missing. It works, but it is a little more difficult to press. Grr.
-
Next, the touchpad. I have mixed feelings about this. On the plus side it is nice to touch; it's smooth, allowing your fingers to glide over the top gently without leaving any marks on there. It also works fine. For the most part. Move your finger up to move the mouse up, move it down to move the mouse down. Left and right obviously applies too. Other simple gestures such as double-tapping, scrolling up and scrolling down and even double-tapping and holding down the second tap to highlight or select something work smoothly.

After about 7-8 months of constant use though things start to get a little bit hectic. The touchpad begins to grow a mind of its own, moving the mouse in a completely different direction to the one you want it to go. You may want to move it left, and it'll suddenly spark off flinging to the right, or might not even work at all! The gestures won't work when it's playing up, so you'll have to control your anger and frustration and wait for it to sort out. Pressing the right button underneath the touchpad seems to cure these problems, but don't ask me why; even to this day it perplexes me.
-
One major problem with this laptop is... overheating. Whether the fan is simply not capable of cooling down the laptop or whether it's because I use it too much hehe, I'm not sure. But regardless, this laptop can reach burning-skin temperatures! (Exaggeration). But seriously, most of the time the laptop is calm and quiet, but suddenly the fan will kick in, the laptop starts to overheat and it even slows down the laptop somewhat. I find it to affect the laptop most of all when I'm playing a video on YouTube. It gets choppy, slows down, and becomes distorted. But the audio is fine! So.. that's good. I recommend either upgrading the fan or getting some sort of mat that can cool it down like I have.
-
The battery is also another issue for me. About 8 months ago I received a little notification in the system tray in the bottom right corner, telling me the battery had messed up. Now, up until that point, the battery worked perfectly! It gives you about 4 hours of playing time, after which a notification pops up in the system tray telling you when to begin charging. Charging doesn't take too long, normally up to an hour to fully charge. The little power pack thing which the charger is connected to tends to get a little bit hot but that is nothing to worry about.

As I said however, the battery is pretty much dead for me. Which means I either keep it charging consistently, all day and even all night, or within an hour, the laptop turns off. I could purchase a new battery, but I just haven't thought about it. I'm willing to put up with it to be brutally honest.
-
The storage that comes with the laptop is a sizeable 250 GB, maybe more, (off the top of my head). Obviously the OS (Windows 7) takes up a little bit of that space as does the processor etc. so you actually get about 230 GB approximately. This is split in to 2 separate areas: the 'C' drive and the 'D' drive. The 'C' drive contains 188 GB and the 'D' drive contains 28.9 GB. For a relaxed consumer such as myself, this is more than adequate. I own some music, some videos, some pictures etc. but nothing too strenuous for the hard-drive to handle.

More recently however, I have started downloading and installing rather large applications such as Adobe Photoshop, Camtasia Studio, Pinnacle Studio HD, iTunes, Zune, and much more. Not to mention my taste in music has branched out into many different genres, meaning my musical collection has grown significantly. Most of the storage is taken up now but for those of you thinking of purchasing a bigger hard-drive, wait. Use services like Microsoft's Cloud Storage which gives you 25 GB of free online storage. It IS SAFE before anyone tells you differently! And, you can store whatever you want in there... music, videos, photos, Microsoft Office documents, whatever you like.
-
The screen is brilliant. Brilliant HD (high definition) display, brilliant size and brilliant colours. It does everything you'd expect it to do. It displays HD pictures and videos perfectly with no fuzziness or distortion (unless the video/picture is not of great quality). I did unfortunately break the screen in a slight fit of rage, but I bought a new screen off of our wonderful rival eBay. This next part is what won me over with this laptop: how easy it is to replace things! I simply memorised a quick tutorial on how to replace the screen off of YouTube, and I did it! It is so simple. Any problems, you're bound to find out how to fix it with this laptop.
-
The laptop comes with its unique OneKey recovery system, which recovers the system back to its original factory settings via installing the laptop's then-current settings on to your own blank discs. It is a simple, but lengthy, process but it is worth it if you want piece of mind even when your laptop gets a virus/trojan.
-
Other specifications such as the 2.1 GHz AMD Athlon dual-core processor, ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4200 graphics card, 2 GB of RAM, built-in HD microphone, built-in 0.3 mega pixel webcam, 3 USB slots (including 1 high-speed), built-in external VGA slot, ethernet port, external slot for headphones and microphone and a re-writeable disc drive, this all adds up to the pretty solid foundation on which the Lenovo G555 sits on. The processor will run anything on your computer smoothly, with hardly any slow-downs or errors popping up. You can play games surprisingly well, but don't expect to be killing enemies on Battlefield 3 with maximum settings, it's not THAT well-equipped. Oh, and the built-in genuine copy of Windows 7 Home Premium means the software it comes with is easy to use, fluid, and the most user-friendly version of Windows yet.
-
I'm not being lazy in not talking about all of those important things in detail, I simply don't think there is any reason to. Most people looking to buy a mid-size budget laptop such as this one probably don't care about the processor, or the graphics card. They're just looking for a laptop that can do what it is supposed to do. Trust me, this laptop will cater for all of your basic digital needs, if you can look past the few but major problems with it. I recommend upgrading a few of the internal components when they start to die off just to give it a new lease of life. Even if you don't, the laptop will continue to run as intended. It is strong-willed, I'll give it that.

So, that's it. I won't talk about the OS, which in this case is the great Windows 7 Home Premium. I mentioned above it's fluid and user-friendly. There are tutorials, guides, help, advice, info, hints, tips and instructions on the laptop itself and all over the internet explaining to you how to use Windows 7 effectively and how to get to grips with it.]

For the most part, the laptop is fine. It is effective at doing what it is supposed to do, it runs things smoothly, the material, although plastic, is smooth to the touch. If you can look past the problems I mentioned earlier, then I guarantee you WILL be pleased with this purchase!

Or, you could wait for Windows 8 to be released. Just sayin'.

B003NDIW2E,Russell Branch,3.0,"So close, but flawed",4 November 2010,the United Kingdom,False,"I have been a Lenovo user for many years, always finding their laptops highly reliable under duress! However, this one has disappointed me.
The problem is the touchpad. It is extremely difficult to use and unresponsive. All previous laptops had a little red ""nipple"" that they call a trackpoint. For some reason, this one doesn't.
I could have guessed there would be problems when I saw a separate sheet giving instructions on exactly where to place the finger to activate the left/right buttons. Unfortunately, they are integrated under the touchpad itself, and in addition, the touchpad surface response to fingertip movement is very poor. An example: it is so easy, especially when editing a document, to be dragging to select some text, only to find it has been magically deleted! I find myself clicking multiple times, moving my finger tips fractions of an inch, until the click is registered. This may seem trivial, but it is the main user interface - and it sucks!

The only real work around is to use a USB mouse, leaving only one USB port.

Such a shame. Otherwise it boots extremely quickly, has more than 4 hours battery life, runs quiet and doesn't get too hot.",13
B003NDIW2E,kunal,4.0,Lenovo G560 - Ideal home use package,24 February 2011,the United Kingdom,False,"Its been a week since I got this device. I personally believe its is an ideal package for home use under it's earlier sale price. Let's look at the pro's and con's from my perspective:

Pros':
1. i5 processer - ample for all home application usage
2. RAM - 2GB DDR 1066mhz ram - sufficient for all basic applications support. Also that it comes as a sigle module, hence you got a free slot to upgrade at your convenience.
3. Windows Home 7 Premium 64 bit preinstalled. Ideal again
4. HDMI & eSATA port availability
5. Decent speaker sound quality as well
6. Fairly simple and elegant looks
7. Very handy Number keypad
8. Volume controls are as touch keys, feels little trendy & convenient

Cons':-
1. Mouse pad and buttons are not too responsive. The looks have been improved, but lacks quality
2. 320GB Hard disk is @ 5400 RPM. the 7200 rpm version should have been better upgrade
3. Web cam is only 0.3 mega pixels. Sounds old & strange against an i5 processor
4. 2 USB ports only. Now since the touchpad is not too responsive, you end up using 1 port for external mouse itself. Hence left with 1 free USB port only.
5. Veriface programm slows the startup. Better off without it.

Conclusion - I personally like it, as it runs fine for all basic usage. So if the pro's are your requirements go for it, If Con's are your needs, look at something else.

Cheers....

B003NDIW2E,Chris Ball,5.0,Lenovo G560 Notebook - Great Value for Money,16 March 2011,the United Kingdom,False,"This is my second purchase of a Lenovo laptop. The brand produces good quality products at reasonable prices. The Intel Core i5 processor plus the Window 7 Home Premium gives a fast and trouble free platform for most Home users requirements. I am impressed by the speed of the processor even when one is running several spreadsheets and have multi websites open. At first glance, the plastic casing appears 'fragile' and shiny but it has proved robust.
The only crticism relates to the 'one piece' touchpad. As other reviewers have also found, you have to be very precise in placing the finger on the 'left' and 'right' buttons. Otherwise, I am delighted with the notebook.",0

B002Q8HMGE,Simon,4.0,Cheap and cheerful but does the job,11 November 2009,the United Kingdom,False,"I bought this laptop for websurfing, watching online TV services like BBC IPlayer and the occational word processing kind of stuff.

First of all, this is not some sexy, super sleek laptop. It looks basic, it is basic but the build quality is good. The only button (apart from the keyboard) is the power button. There are no extra buttons for WIFI off/on, volume mute, or anything like that. I have to say, I like the keyboard. It has good tactile feedback although it is a little louder than my previous Asus laptop was. It is also a good size (the reason I don't like Netbooks is that the keyboards are just too small for my touchtyping style). Also, there is an analogue volume control on the front by the phone and mic sockets - brilliant, really like this, as it controls the main volumn.

Windows 7 is a bit Meh, in my opinion, it's just like Vista but actually works properly. My previous Asus only had 1GB memory and was soooo slow. I got fed-up and put Linux Minut on it. This laptop, with 7, is zippy and responsive but has 3GB of memory, so that could be why it is quicker.

Bad Stuff: It comes installed with a metric tonne of Toshiba cr@pware, as well as trial office and McAffee AntiVirus. Delete... Delete... Delette... Avast, Firefox, Freebird, VLC, all work really well and the cr@pware is gone, thank goodness.

In summary: A decent budget laptop, ditch the cr@pware and it is perfect for coach surfing the web etc...

If you want something to surf the net, and use for word processing rather than intensive gaming or graphics then this is well worth considering. Wireless connection is far better than the Netgear card I had for my other laptop - it connected quickly and has a good connection speed.

Green,4.0,Great little netbook!,24 February 2009,the United Kingdom,False,"This is a fantastic little netbook, its incredibly light and easy to use, the screen is small but I have no difficulty using it, and after a bit of getting used to, the keyboard and touchpad (although small) are very good, and again - easy to use.

The laptop is powerful enough to run most applications, and to my supprise the graphics card can handle most pre-2005 games, any many modern ones requiring 256MB dedicated memory, the intergrated graphics card has about 224MB of ram itself. On the practial side it runs very smoothly with microsoft office 2007, probrably helped by its 1GB of ram.

Battery life, however, is a little dissapointing, using less intensive programs I have only managed to get 2.5hrs off it, but considering its size and weight this has to be compromised.

Build-wise it is as robust as anything, and seems to cope rattling around in my bag every day very well. It has had one accidental drop (of about 3 feet), and all that happened was the battery popped out, not even a scratch on it!

Before buying this I was a little reluctant to buy acer, as reviews have shown they are not the most reliable, unfortunately the first one I was sent was faulty, probrably a problem in the bios where it powered off after about 2 mins. However amazon were fantastic and sent me a replacement straight away, which has been perfect so far.

Overall I would strongly recomend this to anyone looking for a powerful little netbook. It is almost unrivaled as far as value for money goes, and I am so pleased with it I have recently purchased another for my Mother who also seems to be getting along with it great too!

This laptop is still going strong after 6 years of intensive use, which makes it easily been the most solid I have used.

Vista is great and there's some good Vaio-specific software too, like the DVD viewing facilities.

Set-up was easy and user friendly.

B0009H1COM,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,11 September 2020,the United States,False,"Update - the problem with this unit is the fan, not the power supply. I purchased a replacement fan from eBay, and will install it at some point.

Meantime, I purchased another HP TC1100, identical to the first, and everything is perfect. So you can chalk up the difficulties described below, as a fluke. leli001 seems to be selling some decent legacy hardware.

This is an honest-to-goodness XP machine, in tablet form. Same as the other 1 gig memory (which I will upgrade to 2), and around 60 gig hard drive.

Comments regarding the first HP TC1100 tablet, from leli001:

It's a nice machine, but of course is weighty by modern standards. That doesn't matter to me, because I'm just using it on my recliner to play with some legacy 32-bit and Dos applications.

The battery seems to be nearly shot, but perhaps it needs to be charged overnight. I charged it for several hours, and when I ran it without A/C, it was 2 percent charged. That's also unimportant to me, because the recliner has power nearby.

More seriously however, it makes strange noises. Sometimes mild whirring, and sometimes louder repeated high pitched sounds. I'm assuming the hard drive is about to go. If it sticks around long enough for me to make an acronis backup and replace it with a larger drive, that would be fine.

The first thing I did, was upgrade to service pack 3 (from the Microsoft Catalog site), and order another gig of memory. When the memory comes in, I'm not sure it's worth adding at this point.

One great thing about the unit, is how easy it is to disassemble the components, in order to add memory or remove dust. After hearing the noise, I found a YouTube video that explained disassembly. So I went in and checked for dust, and squeezed in some compressed air. Seemed to be ok for a while, but the noise came back.

I'll update this review, as more information becomes available.

Meanwhile - be wary.

I pressed the wrong button and ordered it (along with another item that I did not intend to order right away) and though I tried to cancel the order, the items arrived.

I decided to check out this item before sending it back. I really love its features. It is small and lightweight and great for travel. The screen does not have a very thick frame to it leaving more vision room on the screen. I would definitely recommend it even though I did not get to use it. Of course it can depend on what you would use a laptop like this for. I mostly do general computer things; I search for information on the internet, I read emails , I download documents and forms, I watch videos on YouTube; if I download certain programs or apps I can write and edit letters, or essays or take notes on WPS, or I can edit videos by downloading Windows Essentials and using Movie Maker.
I had to send this item back because I intended to spend money ordering something else, but I hope this item remains available on Amazon for a while because I think I would want to order it at a different time, maybe two of them.
I must say that since I actually did not get to use the item I cannot vouch for how fast the computer system is, or how rugged and long lasting the outer material is and how long the battery life of the computer is. I can only give it 4 out of 5 stars according to my initial impression of the item. But maybe when I do order this item at a later time I can give information on that.
But this seems to be an item that I want.

UPDATE APRIL 3 2025
I finally re-ordered the laptop. It seems good and in working order though I won't be using it full time right away. It has some tilt to the screen which is great for when the laptop is on your lap .
Seems great for travel even though you may have to tolerate a smaller screen.

I hope it will work properly for a long time.

The internal specs, i7-9750H and RTX 2060 in my case, are more than enough to run any modern game when scaled down to 1080p, and when watching 4k content, the screen is bright and sharp.

The main downsides for me were the battery life and the thermals. The battery life is still great for the performance you get, however I was expected just a little better considering the massive 94Wh battery. The laptop also gets quite hot when gaming and the fans spin up pretty audibly, but this was an expected tradeoff in a thin and light performance laptop.

Fans were noticeable but not so bothersome. I used this on a slightly angled laptop stand and when gaming (while charging, whether this affects the outcome is not known yet) there’s a component, I’m guessing fan, that begins clicking repeatedly throughout the entire gaming session. Only happens when angled with the trackpad below keyboard. I tried getting past this flaw, but unfortunately I will be returning this device due to this as well as obvious discoloration on display.

On a side note, gaming was fine. I only played Path of Exile in 4K with low to medium settings and got between 50-60 FPS on a 60Hz display so it was nice.

Wrong.
But before that, some context, and actual laptop review:
Defects right out of the box. Buggy software , the keyboard and the screen don't work until multiple restarts which is super annoying.

Love the screen though. MY major issue pre-purchase was the size of the letters on the keyboard as theres a numkey shoved in. I'm very picky when it comes to adjustments, and while there were a few minor adjustments required, nothing major to dent my typing experience.

Back to amazon support:
Amazon support is essentially a glorified go-between between the seller's customer service and you. What happens when the seller's support is non-responsive? Well, Amazon doesnt respond either. After being unable to find a solution to the problem, I asked for a replacement laptop, which they couldnt provide...ok

Call in the warranty and get the laptop repaired? Cant do that.

Ok....

What amazon CAN do is to offer a refund once the laptop is shipped back to them (you bearing the shipping costs ofcourse).

Tldr: Amazon product support is a dud. Gigabyte support is crappy. STAY AWAY FROM PURCHASING this laptop. (laptpops pretty good though but not remotely worth it in the grand scheme of things)

B07SD88Z1F,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,16 July 2019,the United States,False,"I just received this laptop today so I will try to update my review after a few days of usage. So far I love it. The OLED display is amazing, it doesn't get overly hot, the build quality is very nice and I like the customizable RGB keyboard. I'm just finishing up the installation and updates but already ran a few programs and tried a few games. So far it is outperforming the new Dell XPS 15 (OLED as well) I also purchased that has an i9. The keyboard is going to take some getting used to with the NUM pad included but I think I will be fine after a few days. It is very easy to upgrade the SSD and RAM as well. The fingerprint reader and track-pad are excellent.

UPDATE 7/28/2019:
These are my thoughts after the first week of usage keeping it from being the perfect laptop for me:

* The keyboard is shifted left and too small for normal sized hands in my opinion. After a week I am still miss-keying alot. They should eliminate the NUM pad and make the keyboard QWERTY section larger and centered.
* The charging port is on the right whereas the ideal location would be on the left side for me.
* There are no skins available.
* The secondary keys do not light up so you have to color code certain keys for common tasks like volume, punctuation keys, brightness etc. It is very annoying and not really acceptable if you use the laptop in low light. Have your phone near by to light it up as needed.
* The camera switch locks open but does not locked closed. I close it and it somehow it constantly opens on it's own. I wish it were at the top, better quality and had IR for Windows Hello.
* The Gigabyte Control center often crashes when changing settings or RGB options and won't open unless you kill it in task manager and re-open it. A future update may solve this.
* The large sticker that comes on the palm rest, once removed, leaves an outline of where the sticker was that will not rub off. I'm not sure if the adhesive they used stained the finish or what but it's clear there was a sticker there.

It is still a great laptop, just consider the above.

After getting to school, the fan eventually stopped working completely, causing the laptop to overheat and crash when doing things as simple as web browsing. Communicating with Gigabyte took 3 or more days between responses, and ended with having to pay $100 in shipping due to the warranty being limited, not full. It took nearly a two weeks (aside from shipping times) for a simple fan replacement that would likely take a technician no longer than an hour. During this time I had to work out getting a temporary laptop to use for school, which was an ordeal in and of itself.

After receiving the laptop for the second time, it worked perfectly and I was once again happy. It is now 1 year later, and the other fan just died. The warranty only lasts a year, so it's up by now. I could easily do the replacement myself, but Gigabyte is stingy with their parts and I can only find a replacement fan from a third party for $85, which is far higher than the actual value of the part. After lots of research last year and this year, this seems to be a relatively common problem with the Aero 15 series in general. Despite loving the laptop when it works, this experience has prompted me to never want to buy a product from Gigabyte again.

Don't be optimistic, don't be fooled by the generally good specs, don't take a risk, and don't waste your money; a laptop of this price should absolutely not have problems as simple as these, with such poor customer support to back it up. Despite the fact that there are some favorable reviews, if you would rather not deal with these same issues, go with a more reputable manufacturer.

B07CYYY71S,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,26 September 2019,the United States,False,"I really liked this tablet. As opposed to the options available from Lenovo themselves, this has the perfect balance of storage, processing power, and RAM that I can use. How do more people not know about this? I know so many people that went with the mainstream version of this form factor (without the Thunderbolt 3 and other wonderful features) and would have gone with this one in a heartbeat if they knew that this existed!

Likes:
- Thunderbolt 3 ports!!!!! I can plug in an external GPU or anything that uses USB C or a docking station or whatever! I love this inclusion in the form factor when the competition doesn't have enough sense to do the same.
- The battery life really does depend on your usage, but I've been able to get a full day out of it with no sweat. If you need to extend your battery life then one investment to make is a 45W battery pack that can charge this tablet via USB PD.
- The screen is bright and sharp and it's very responsive to touch.
- The keyboard is as nice as you'd expect from a ThinkPad Product, but is a little bit shallower in comparison to the other ThinkPad laptops.
- The kickstand works flawlessly and reversing the keyboard allows for use in my lap easily.

Dislikes:
- The pen that came with it was not very good and did not have Bluetooth functionality, but at this price when comparing to the competition I could get the Bamboo Ink stylus and it works very well.

B07CYYY71S,Anonyme,5.0,Sans titre,19 November 2019,the United States,False,I bought this computer as a design and business driver and I'm thoroughly impressed. It says it has 8gb ram on the product but actually has 16gb ram which was a pleasant surprise. It's very fast and powerful. Very easy to use with lots of features. The pen is okay and could be better but is still a great addition. Its portability and speed allows me to better portray ideas and possibilities to clients better than trying to just explain it to them. The display is also very good. I've heard a lot about how the speakers could be better but personally I think they are pretty good. Of course you probably won't be able to hear them in louder settings but why wouldn't you just use headphones in those situations on any device. The keyboard is probably one of the best features because of how comfortable and tactile it is. I would have bought this computer sooner if I would have found it sooner. Great buy!,0
B07CYYY71S,Anonyme,4.0,Sans titre,12 October 2019,the United States,False,"This is a worthy competitor of Surface Pro 6, even SP 7. Especially at 1100 dollars (itreplay seller) for i7 model, which is also the current price of SP6 i7 model with no Thunderbolts 3 and smaller SSD. As a designer, I've been using Windows tablets since the late 90s. This is a replacement for 3 years old Surface Pro 4.

Pros:
- Just like Surface Pro but bigger screen and higher resolution.
- Thunderbolt 3 ports, which means you can use eGPU.
- Solid keyboard, better than SP keyboard.

Cons:
- Screen scratch issue: This is a known issue for all X1 Tablet users. You'll need a screen protector that is not included. Most people use Photodon brand.
- Battery life is very short, it is the worse I've seen. It lasts a little over 4 hours for drawing. It'll be much shorter when battery gets older.
- Unlike the OS on SP which is a optimized Win10 for SP. X1's Win10 is OEM one that is full of bloatware and takes up 3GB RAM just to boot it.
- The pen is not the one shown in the images, it's the older generation with a hard plastic tip that makes drawing on glass like skating on ice, not good.

Interestingly it doesn't come in retail box, at least not the US retail box. It comes in brow box with Lenovo seal, it also comes with a big protector case which I wasn't expecting it. Mine was manufactured in July 2018, it took almost an hour to update all the Windows and Lenovo's patches.

Mine is slightly defective, upper right bezel area is separated from the external frame. It makes clicking noise when pressed as the glass flexes. So check yours before spent hour updating OS.

B07711NY6P,Wenxin Li,5.0,Perfect desktop replacement gaming laptop! (Will update and change review if thing go wrong),10 October 2018,the United Kingdom,False,"Great laptop for perfect gaming experience! I was very excited when it arrived and used the whole afternoon to test it. I am very happy with it so far.

Pros
-Needless to say that you can play all games on the market smoothly with ultra settings. (I got the 1080 version and according to my knowledge, the 1070 is also totally fine for now)
-Great looking(didn’t bother to post pictures with the lights, you can search on YouTube if interested)
-The keyboard feels great to type on. My personal favorite.
-Despite the high CPU temp, the body and keyboard of the laptop stay extremely cool and comfortable to use during intensive gaming. This laptops provides a perfect gaming experience.
-I think this is the best value in the category of desktop replacement laptop(desktops that are bulky but provides desktop level experience such as no tangiable heat and no compromise in power even during extensive periods of gaming.)

Cons

-CPU gets a little bit too hot(90 to 96 degree) while gaming under 1080p+ultra settings (for games such as Witcher3 and assassin’s creed origin), but no drop in framrates at all with over 2 hours of testing so this won’t affect your gaming experience.
-The i7 7820HK is not a future provf CPU, its performance is simliar to that of an 8th gen i5. So don’t buy if you are going to do a lot of CPU intensive tasks.
-Fans can get pretty loud. Totally fine if you wear earphones/headphones.
-Pretty heavy.

13/10/2018 update：The CPU is pure garbage that has ruined this otherwise perfect laptop(Not Sure if I just got unlucky and had a defective unit)
The i7 7820HK’s performance is miles away from i7-8700, but that’s not the main issue since most games are more graphically demanding. THe main issue is that core temperature gets shockingly high even at default settings. It basically gets over 95 degree every time you play a CPU demanding game for over 10 mintues! Just experienced my first shutdown this afternoon when played AC origin for less than 2 hours and the CPU hit 100 degree...I don’t really have time to test it for more than 2 hours since I am in college, but I just can not imagine how bad things can go if I play demanding games for extensive period of time. I then searched online and found that lots of people are complaining Omens about CPU heating yet still only very few has reached over 90 degree.
Most other brands, however, can easliy keep their cpu temperature at low 80s for a laptop this huge.(for example Asus Predator Helios 500) A lesson from HP: do not just look at the specs. Heat management can be much more important.
28/01/2018
The laptop has not slowed even a little bit after months of use and the CPU heat issue was solved. It turned out that some games are just poorly optimized. For example AC Origin gets the CPU to as high as 95 degree while Ooddessy only gets it to 85 degree. You can also bring the temperature even lower by leaving the bottom middle part in the air(for example put the laptop in the middle of two piles of books). Sometimes I play AAA games for over 10 hours on Sundays without getting any slowdown!

B076KQS1H5,Benoit Brummer,2.0,"Almost great laptop, butchered by HP",23 March 2018,the United Kingdom,False,"Powerful AMD laptop butchered by HP.

- It was released even though the drivers are not quite ready for Linux (at least I hope that's the issue), the laptop crashes too often (mainly when running anything too intensive for the iGPU, and some basic programs like Eclipse), there is no working sleep mode, and the webcam and digitizer are not yet supported.
- HP's support is the worst. It took me several days to get a way to update the bios without a windows partition, and that involved finding a login for their recovery livecd. Support is done through a forum, not directly, and HP reps don't seem helpful. The bios listed on their support page is not even that of this laptop, I had to click on the link for previous versions because it seems they dumped all AMD laptop bioses there (check the motherboard model for a compatible bios).
- The fan gets too loud when the CPU gets busy, I can't bring it to class if I need to run heavy computations in the background.
- Last but not least, the display is of terrible quality. The whites are yellow. This isn't the clean display that was used in the early batch sent for reviews, HP disgustingly switched to a vastly inferior display after the reviews were in. There is no hope of using this laptop for photography development.

The RAM is upgradable (I was succesful with Crucial CT8G4SFS824A 8GB, getting it up to 12GB) but really not made easy to access.

The laptop is beautiful and fast.

B012VMWB9C,L. Smith,1.0,Nice spec but big problems,2 December 2015,the United Kingdom,False,"On the face of it, this had a great spec for the price and, being Lenovo, the reliability of the hardware was expected to be good. The documentation and the digital manual could be a whole lot better, however, as there's no information on regular computer maintenance or recovery options - but having already got an old Lenovo, that wasn't too much of a problem.

The first boot up recommends to upgrade to Windows 10 before you ever get to the Desktop - which was the reason I bought it in the first place - so it helped not having to manually apply for the update and wait my turn. The installation seemed to go fine and, by the end of the arrival day, I had the compo running Windows 10.

For the next five days, I went through trying to learn the computer system, switching off privacy issues and removing apps. I didn't move any of my software over to the compo until I could be sure it was working okay. I noticed that a couple of times the system hung but I got no error messages so continued on.

It was on the fourth day that I accessed the Reliability Monitor and found a plethora of system errors and problems, only two of which were duplicated by the same app/process. After contacting Microsoft and spending 5 hours with them, the machine was in a worse state than when I first rang them (but I must point out that I don't hold them responsible). Eventually, they managed to install and repair a new administrator account alongside the corrupted original - but they still hadn't been able to address the root of the problem.

After all, you might be able to produce something new, the way the corrupted account once was - but unless you understand and have changed what caused it to become corrupted in the first place, it's only going to happen again.

Whether there is something in the computer that is causing these system errors or whether it's just a faulty piece of software (or whether the win 10 upgrade wasn't perfect), it would take hours, days and months to determine. My advice would be to steer clear of this laptop and, perhaps, even wait til Lenovo start to bring out laptops with Win 10 pre-loaded before jumping in to the new system.

Although this hasn't put me off buying a Lenovo computer, it's given me the impression that any computer (even one straight from the box) that upgrades to Win 10 is going to be at a higher risk to run into problems than one that's pre-installed.

PS - after writing the above, I remembered that the Energy Management utility, provided by Lenovo, was showing that the Battery was not a genuine Lenovo part and should be replaced. Also that it could not use its programming to look after the battery because of that. The box was security sealed when received so that appears to be a Lenovo problem, perhaps with the Energy Management software (see attached screenshot).
